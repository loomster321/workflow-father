# Reference: Deferred Requirement â€“ Visual Narrative Design Agent Scope & Feedback Loop

**Date:** 2024-07-11

## Summary of Discussion

This document captures a key insight and deferred requirement regarding the optimal placement and function of the Visual Narrative Design agent in the Video Production Workflow.

### 1. Issue Identified
- The Visual Narrative Design agent is currently positioned to process B-Roll concepts at the shot level, synthesizing transitions and visual flow between individual shots.
- This limits the agent's ability to ensure visual and emotional coherence across entire scenes or the full video.

### 2. Recommendation
- **Elevate the Visual Narrative Design agent to operate at the scene or video level.**
  - At the scene level: Ensures intra-scene consistency and logical transitions.
  - At the video level: Enables global visual motifs, recurring elements, and consistency across scenes.
- The agent should output a comprehensive visual narrative guide that includes project-wide style, scene-level transitions, and shot-level details in context.

### 3. Feedback Loop Enhancement
- Implement a feedback loop in the chat interface that allows users to provide feedback at the shot, scene, or video level.
- The system should support propagating feedback upstream, triggering revisions to the scene or overall visual narrative as needed.
- The workflow should re-invoke relevant agents with the appropriate context and propagate changes downstream.

### 4. Workflow Implications
- Greater creative control and flexibility for directors and reviewers.
- Improved consistency and coherence in visual storytelling.
- Supports iterative, non-linear creative processes.

### 5. Deferred Requirement Statement
- This requirement is deferred for future implementation but is considered high priority for ensuring the effectiveness and creative power of the workflow.

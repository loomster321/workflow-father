# The Ultimate Guide to Photorealistic Prompts in Midjourney

Creating truly photorealistic images in Midjourney requires a strategic approach to prompt engineering. Based on the information you've shared and best practices in the field, I've compiled this comprehensive guide to help you achieve exceptional results.

## Core Principles for Photorealism

### 1. Structured Prompt Design

Begin with a high-level subject and layer in specifics. Use conversational, grammatically correct sentences instead of keyword spam.

- **Scene Setup**: Start broad then add detail (e.g., "a middle-aged man repairing a bike" → "in a cluttered garage with natural light streaming through dusty windows")
- **Natural Language Flow**: Write in coherent sentences rather than disconnected keywords (e.g., "A young man with glasses works intently on his laptop, bathed in soft natural light from a nearby window")
- **Optimal Component Order**: subject → details → setting → style/medium

### 2. Technical Photography Specificity

Photography terminology signals to the AI that you want realistic imagery:

- **Camera Equipment**: Specify lens type ("100mm macro"), aperture ("f/2.8"), and camera models
- **Lighting Conditions**: Use precise terminology like "golden hour glow," "studio three-point lighting," or "overhead garage lighting"
- **Material Properties**: Include texture descriptors like "weathered leather jacket" or "rough brick walls"

### 3. Avoid Vague Descriptors

Midjourney disregards non-descriptive phrases like "award-winning" or "8K." Instead, replace terms like "photorealistic" with explicit technical details (e.g., "shot on Canon EOS R5, 85mm f/1.4")

Always use `--style raw` to minimize artistic interpretation when aiming for photorealism.

## Advanced Techniques

### Parameter Optimization

- **Stylization Control**: Use `--stylize 750` or `--s 750` to achieve balanced detail
- **Aspect Ratio**: Select ratios that match real camera formats (e.g., `--ar 3:2` for standard DSLR, `--ar 9:16` for phone camera)
- **Seed Management**: Employ `--seed` parameter with values between 0-4294967295 to maintain consistency while testing incremental prompt changes

### Content-Specific Strategies

#### Portrait Photography

Example: "Close-up of a French woman with green eyes, wearing a silk scarf, shot on Canon R5 (85mm f/1.4) in Parisian café lighting – soft shadows, warm tones --style raw"

Key elements:

- Subject demographics and distinguishing features
- Environmental context
- Specific lighting mood and color temperature
- Shallow depth of field for portraits (f/1.4-f/2.8)

#### Landscape Photography

Example: "Snow-capped Alps at sunrise, Nikon Z9 (24mm f/8), golden hour light casting long shadows on pine trees – hyper-detailed textures --style raw"

Key elements:

- Geographical specificity
- Time of day for lighting conditions
- Wide-angle lens with smaller aperture (f/8-f/16) for deep focus
- Weather and atmospheric conditions

## Workflow Best Practices

### Iterative Approach

Begin with simple prompts and gradually add complexity. Use Midjourney's Remix Mode to refine outputs based on initial results.

### Template System

Create a library of reusable prompt components (lighting setups, camera profiles, common subjects) to maintain consistency.

Example template structure:

[Subject] + [Action/Pose] + [Environment] + [Time of Day] + [Camera Settings] + [Lighting] + [Style Parameters]

### Prompt Length Management

While current versions handle longer prompts better than previous ones, avoid exceeding ~7 key concepts to prevent "token loss" where important details are overlooked.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Overloading**: Too many competing concepts dilute the final result
2. **Vague Descriptors**: Terms like "beautiful" or "amazing" add little value
3. **Conflicting Instructions**: Contradictory elements (e.g., "vintage and futuristic")
4. **Over-reliance on Camera Names**: While mentioning specific camera models can help, focus more on descriptive lighting and composition

## Special Effects Techniques

### Text Integration

For including text in images: Enclose desired text in quotes (e.g., "Welcome" on a neon sign)

### Specific Materials

For particularly challenging textures like glass, water, or metal, reference both the material and its behavior:

- "Crystal clear water reflecting sunlight with subtle ripples"
- "Brushed stainless steel with subtle fingerprint smudges"

## Example Prompt Library

1. **Corporate Portrait**:
   "Professional headshot of a confident business executive (45-year-old man), navy suit, neutral office background, Canon EOS R5 with 85mm portrait lens at f/2.0, professional studio lighting with soft fill, standard corporate photography --style raw"

2. **Product Photography**:
   "White ceramic coffee mug on marble countertop, morning sunlight from side window creating subtle shadows, shot on Sony A7R IV with 90mm macro lens at f/8, product photography lighting setup --style raw"

3. **Architectural Interior**:
   "Minimalist living room with floor-to-ceiling windows, Scandinavian furniture, afternoon light casting geometric shadows, shot on wide-angle 16mm lens at f/11, architectural photography with tilt-shift effect --style raw"

By applying these principles and techniques, you'll be able to consistently generate highly photorealistic images with Midjourney that match your creative vision.

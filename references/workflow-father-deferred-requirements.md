## 1. Multi-User Collaboration

**Rationale:** Many workflows are developed by teams. Clear guidance on collaboration prevents errors and confusion.

**Guidance:**
- Use version control (e.g., git) for all workflow documents.
- Document all major changes in the change log.
- Assign clear ownership for each section.
- Resolve merge conflicts by consensus and document decisions.

---

## 2. Accessibility and Internationalization

**Rationale:** Workflows may be used by people with different accessibility needs or in different languages.

**Guidance:**
- Ensure all diagrams and documents are accessible (e.g., alt text for images, high-contrast colors in diagrams).
- For international teams, consider language localization and avoid idiomatic expressions.
- Use clear, simple language and provide translations where appropriate.

---

## 3. Template/Boilerplate Section

**Rationale:** Templates speed up new workflow creation and ensure compliance with required structure.

**Guidance:**
- Provide a downloadable or copy-pasteable template (markdown/HTML) with all required sections and example placeholders.
- Update the template as the instructions evolve.

---

## 4. Automated Validation Tools

**Rationale:** Manual checking is error-prone. Automated tools can catch missing sections, broken links, or formatting issues.

**Guidance:**
- Use automated linting or validation tools to check for missing sections, broken cross-references, and formatting errors before finalizing the document.
- Integrate validation into the workflow's CI/CD pipeline if possible.

---

## 5. Security and Privacy Checklist

**Rationale:** Many workflows process sensitive data and must comply with security/privacy standards.

**Guidance:**
- Review all data flows for security and privacy compliance.
- Mask or redact sensitive data in documentation.
- Ensure authentication and authorization are addressed for all integrations.
- Follow relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

---

## 6. Feedback and Continuous Improvement Loop

**Rationale:** Instructions and workflows improve over time with user feedback.

**Guidance:**
- Encourage users to submit feedback or suggestions for improving the workflow instructions.
- Regularly review and update the instructions based on real-world usage and new best practices.
- Maintain a changelog for the instructions themselves.

---

## 7. Reference to External Standards

**Rationale:** Aligning with industry standards (e.g., BPMN, ISO, ITIL) adds credibility and interoperability.

**Guidance:**
- Where possible, align workflow documentation with relevant industry standards.
- Reference these standards in the document and provide links to official resources.

---

## 8. Visual Style Guide

**Rationale:** Consistent visual presentation improves readability and professionalism.

**Guidance:**
- Define a color palette, font choices, and icon usage for diagrams and tables.
- Use high-contrast colors and accessible fonts.
- Provide example diagrams and tables as part of the style guide.

---

## 9. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Rationale:** Anticipates and answers common user questions, reducing onboarding time.

**Guidance:**
- Maintain a FAQ section at the end of the instructions.
- Update the FAQ as new questions arise from users or team members.

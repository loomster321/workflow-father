# Video Structure

When thinking about the structure of a video—whether it's a feature film, a short film, or even a well-edited music video—we can break it down into several hierarchical segments, arranged from the longest overall segment to the most granular unit. Here’s a typical breakdown:

## 1. The Entire Video

At the top level is the complete work: the full video or film. This is the overarching narrative or concept that encompasses all other elements.

## 2. Acts or Chapters

For many narrative videos, the overall story is divided into major sections often called **acts** (commonly three or five) or **chapters** in longer formats. Each act deals with a specific part of the narrative arc, such as exposition, rising action, climax, and resolution. In non-narrative or experimental videos, you might structure the content into thematic chapters.

## 3. Sequences

Within each act, the video is further divided into **sequences**. A sequence is a series of scenes that are linked by a common idea, location, or theme, and together they move the narrative or concept forward. Sequences allow for a smooth transition between major parts of the story.

## 4. Scenes

A **scene** is a continuous block of storytelling that takes place in a single location or time. Scenes are the building blocks of sequences, and they typically encapsulate a specific event or interaction that drives the story or message.

## 5. Shots

Within each scene, the action is captured through **shots**. A shot is the basic unit of filming—a continuous recording made by a single camera without interruption. Shots can vary widely in length and are selected to visually compose the scene, convey emotion, and drive the narrative rhythm.

## 6. Frames

At the most granular level, each shot is made up of individual **frames**. Frames are the still images that, when played in rapid succession (usually at 24, 25, or 30 frames per second), create the illusion of movement. Although we rarely think of frames as separate segments in the planning phase, they are the fundamental components that make up every shot.

## Bringing It All Together

Understanding this hierarchical structure—from the entire video down to individual frames—helps in both planning and editing. It ensures that every element, from broad narrative arcs to the minutiae of frame composition, contributes effectively to the overall vision and storytelling pace of the video. This architecture is essential in guiding the viewer’s experience, maintaining continuity, and ensuring that the pacing and emotional rhythm of the film work harmoniously.

This framework is a common blueprint in filmmaking, but keep in mind that experimental or non-traditional videos might bend or break these rules to serve creative purposes.

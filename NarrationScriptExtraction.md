# Narration Script Extraction Agent Instructions

## Purpose

Extract only the narration (spoken lines) from a mixed script containing both narration and production notes. The output should be a clean, ordered list of narration lines, omitting all production or visual direction notes.

---

## Extraction Criteria

- **Narration** includes any text explicitly spoken by a narrator or character, typically introduced by a speaker label (e.g., `### Narrator:`, `#### Dr. Leslie:`, or similar).
- **Exclude** all production notes, visual directions, scene descriptions, and text not directly spoken (e.g., lines in italics, asterisks, or between `*...*`).
- **Include** only the actual spoken content, not the speaker labels themselves.

---

## Extraction Steps

1. **Identify Narration Blocks**

   - Locate headings or labels that indicate a speaker (e.g., `### Narrator:`, `#### Jamie:`).
   - The narration typically follows these headings, up to the next heading, label, or production note.

2. **Extract Spoken Lines**

   - Copy the text immediately following the speaker label, up to the next heading, label, or production note.
   - If the narration is split into multiple paragraphs under the same speaker, include all relevant paragraphs.
   - **Do not include any section or scene headings (e.g., `## Scene One`) in the output.**

3. **Ignore Production Notes and Headings**

   - Skip any lines that are:
     - Enclosed in asterisks (`*...*`)
     - Italicized and not part of a speaker label
     - Scene descriptions, visual cues, or text highlights
     - **Any section or scene headings (e.g., `## Scene One`)**
     - Headings not directly followed by spoken lines

4. **Clean and Format Output**

   - Remove all speaker labels.
   - Present the narration_text as a single continuous string.
   - Ensure no production notes, section headings, or non-narration content is included.

---

## Output Format

- Provide the extracted narration as a JSON object with a single string property named "narration_text".
- **Do not include any section or scene headings, speaker labels, or production notes. Only the spoken narration lines should be present.**
- **Return only the raw JSON object (not wrapped in markdown code blocks, not as a string, and without any extra wrappers or formatting). Do not use triple backticks, 'json' tags, or any markdown formatting. The output must be a valid JSON object, not a string or markdown.**
- **The narration_text must be returned as a single string of text, not as an array. Concatenate all narration lines in the order they appear, separated by spaces or newlines as appropriate.**

## JSON Input/Output Examples

### Example Input

```json
{
  "original_text": "## Scene One\n\n*Gentle rain sounds. A cozy living room is shown.*\n\n### Narrator (Alex):\n\n\"It was a morning like any other, but something felt different. The air was filled with possibility.\"\n\n### Jamie:\n\n\"Are you ready for the big day?\"\n\n*Camera pans to a calendar marked with a red circle.*"
}
```

### Example Output

```json
{
  "narration_text": "It was a morning like any other, but something felt different. The air was filled with possibility. Are you ready for the big day?"
}
```

---

## Additional Notes

- If a speaker label is ambiguous, default to excluding the block unless it is clearly spoken narration.
- For testimonials or quoted client lines, include only the quoted speech, not the label or attribution.
- For nested speech (e.g., a character quoting another character), include all levels of quoted speech as part of the narration_text.

## Error Handling

If no narration is found, return:

```json
{
  "narration_text": ""
}
```

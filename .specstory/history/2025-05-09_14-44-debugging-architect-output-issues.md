# Debugging Architect Output Issues (2025-05-09 07:44:26)

_**User**_

Getting this output from the architect but I have no way of finding the exact problem. 

[
  {
    "output": "Agent stopped due to max iterations."
  }
]

It happens after several successful operations including successfully obtaining feedback from the architect.

Here is the last log before the output.

{"decisions": ["Re-segment all scenes into shots/beats with max 15 words each.", "Use correct duration formula (word_count/2.5) for all narration.", "Sum subsegment durations for all parent segments.", "Enforce strict field validation."], "thought_process": "Received 'fail' from Critic Tool. Segmentation at scene/shot level is insufficient (shots missing, narration text per segment too long). Duration and word_count calculations are inaccurate (wrong divisor: should be /2.5, not /2). Parent durations must sum child durations. Will correct by subdividing all narration into true shots (10-15 words/2-5 seconds) and adjust all word counts/durations accordingly."}

ASny ideas how we can better instrument the architect to determine source of the problem?

_**Assistant**_

You’re encountering a classic “max iterations” failure in an agentic loop, where the Script Architecture Agent is unable to produce a Critic Tool “pass” after several revision cycles. The log you provided shows the agent is receiving actionable feedback and attempting to revise, but something is preventing convergence—likely a persistent validation or segmentation issue.

## Why This Is Hard to Debug

- The agent’s output is opaque: you only see “Agent stopped due to max iterations.”
- The last log is high-level and doesn’t pinpoint which segment(s) or field(s) are failing.
- If the Critic Tool’s feedback isn’t logged in detail, you can’t see what it’s objecting to on each cycle.

---

## Instrumentation Recommendations

To make debugging easier, you need **more granular, structured logging** at each revision cycle, especially when the Critic Tool returns “fail” or “revise.” Here’s how you can improve instrumentation:

### 1. **Log Critic Tool Feedback in Full**

- **Current:** Only high-level decisions are logged.
- **Recommended:** Log the full Critic Tool feedback (status, messages, offending segment labels, field names, etc.) as a structured JSON object.
- **How:**  
  - After each Critic Tool call, append a log entry with:
    - The full feedback object
    - The current iteration number
    - The segment label(s) referenced in the feedback (if any)
    - The agent’s planned response

**Example:**
```javascript
Append Agent Log(
  "Script Architecture",
  "critic_feedback",
  {
    "iteration": 3,
    "critic_status": "fail",
    "critic_feedback": { ...full feedback object... },
    "thought_process": "Received fail, will address issues in scene-2_shot-1 and scene-2_shot-3.",
    "decisions": ["Subdivide shots as per feedback", "Recalculate durations"]
  },
  "" // Or the top-level segment label if available
)
```

---

### 2. **Log Field-Level Validation Failures**

- **Current:** Only segmentation decisions and tool usage are logged.
- **Recommended:** When a segment fails validation (e.g., missing field, duration too long), log:
  - The segment label
  - The specific field(s) and value(s) that failed
  - The validation rule violated

**Example:**
```javascript
Append Agent Log(
  "Script Architecture",
  "field_validation",
  {
    "segment_label": "act-1_seq-2_scene-3_shot-2",
    "failed_fields": [
      {"field": "word_count", "value": 22, "rule": "max 15 words per shot"},
      {"field": "duration", "value": 9.0, "rule": "max 5 seconds per shot"}
    ],
    "thought_process": "Shot exceeds word and duration limits.",
    "decisions": ["Will split into two shots"]
  },
  "act-1_seq-2_scene-3_shot-2"
)
```

---

### 3. **Log Iteration Count and Termination Reason**

- **Current:** Only the final “max iterations” message is output.
- **Recommended:** On termination, log:
  - The total number of iterations
  - The last Critic Tool feedback
  - The unresolved issues (if any)
  - The agent’s final state (e.g., which segments are still failing)

**Example:**
```javascript
Append Agent Log(
  "Script Architecture",
  "end_processing",
  {
    "iteration": 5,
    "termination_reason": "max_iterations",
    "last_critic_feedback": { ... },
    "unresolved_segments": ["act-1_seq-2_scene-3_shot-2"],
    "thought_process": "Unable to resolve shot segmentation within 5 iterations."
  },
  ""
)
```

---

### 4. **(Optional) Output a Debug Report on Failure**

- When the agent stops due to max iterations, output a debug report (as a separate field or file) summarizing:
  - The last N Critic Tool feedbacks
  - The segments/fields that repeatedly failed
  - The agent’s attempted fixes

---

## Implementation Steps

1. **Update the agent’s logging logic** to include the above log points.
2. **Ensure Critic Tool feedback is always captured and logged in full.**
3. **On each validation failure, log the exact field, value, and rule.**
4. **On termination, log a summary of unresolved issues.**
5. (Optional) **Expose a debug report** in the agent’s output for easier review.

---

## Why This Will Help

- You’ll be able to see exactly which segment/field is causing the loop.
- You’ll know if the agent is failing to fix the same issue repeatedly, or if new issues are being introduced.
- You can quickly spot if the Critic Tool is being too strict, or if the agent’s logic is buggy.

---

## Next Steps

- Would you like a code snippet or pseudo-code for the enhanced logging logic?
- Do you want to see an example of a debug report structure?
- Or do you want help identifying where in your codebase to add these logs?

Let me know how you’d like to proceed!

_**User**_

But there was only one iteration of feedback from the critic.

---

_**Assistant**_

Thank you for clarifying—if there was only **one iteration** of Critic Tool feedback, but the agent still hit a “max iterations” stop, this suggests a different class of problem:

- The agent is **not making progress** after the first Critic Tool “fail” (i.e., it’s stuck in a loop, or not actually re-invoking the Critic Tool).
- Or, the agent is **not applying the Critic’s feedback** at all, so it never gets a new result.
- Or, there’s a **logic or state bug** causing the agent to immediately hit the iteration limit (e.g., a counter is off, or the loop is misconfigured).

---

## What This Implies

- **If you only see one Critic Tool feedback and then a max-iteration stop:**  
  The agent is likely not entering the revision loop, or is failing to update its state/output for a new Critic Tool call.
- **If the log shows “Received ‘fail’ from Critic Tool” but no further logs:**  
  The agent may be:
  - Not actually calling the Critic Tool again after attempting a fix.
  - Failing to update the script structure before the next Critic Tool call.
  - Hitting an exception or error that aborts the loop after the first feedback.

---

## How to Instrument for This Case

You need to **log the following at each loop iteration** (even if there’s only one):

1. **Iteration number** (e.g., “Starting revision iteration 1”)
2. **Whether a revision was attempted** (did the agent actually change the structure?)
3. **Whether the Critic Tool was called again** (log the call and its result)
4. **If the agent is about to stop, log why** (e.g., “No changes made, stopping” or “Max iterations reached after 1 loop”)

---

### Example Logging Points

```javascript
Append Agent Log(
  "Script Architecture",
  "revision_iteration",
  {
    "iteration": 1,
    "received_critic_feedback": true,
    "attempted_revision": true,
    "called_critic_tool_again": false, // or true
    "thought_process": "Attempted to revise structure, but did not call Critic Tool again due to [reason]."
  },
  ""
)
```

---

## What to Check in Your Code

- **Is the revision loop actually running?**  
  (Is the agent’s loop/recursion/iteration logic correct, or does it exit after the first fail?)
- **Is the Critic Tool being called again after a revision?**
- **Is the agent’s state being updated between iterations?**
- **Is there an exception or error that aborts the loop?**  
  (Check for silent failures or unhandled exceptions.)

---

## Next Steps

- **Add logging at the start and end of each revision loop iteration.**
- **Log every Critic Tool call and its result.**
- **Log any early exits or errors.**

This will quickly show you if the agent is:
- Not entering the loop
- Not revising
- Not calling the Critic Tool again
- Or hitting an error

---

**Would you like a code snippet for this kind of loop instrumentation, or help identifying where to add these logs in your agent code?**

---

_**User**_

Start with the code snippet.

---

_**Assistant**_

Certainly! Here’s a **pseudo-code / code snippet** for robust instrumentation of the revision loop in your Script Architecture Agent. This pattern will help you pinpoint where the process is stalling or failing to iterate.

---

## Instrumented Revision Loop Example

Assume you have a function like `run_revision_loop()` that handles the Critic Tool feedback and revision cycles.

```python
MAX_ITERATIONS = 5
iteration = 0
critic_status = None
last_critic_feedback = None

while iteration < MAX_ITERATIONS:
    # Log the start of the iteration
    Append_Agent_Log(
        "Script Architecture",
        "revision_iteration",
        {
            "iteration": iteration + 1,
            "thought_process": f"Starting revision iteration {iteration + 1}."
        },
        ""
    )

    # Call the Critic Tool and log the feedback
    critic_feedback = call_critic_tool(current_structure)
    critic_status = critic_feedback.get("status")
    last_critic_feedback = critic_feedback

    Append_Agent_Log(
        "Script Architecture",
        "critic_feedback",
        {
            "iteration": iteration + 1,
            "critic_status": critic_status,
            "critic_feedback": critic_feedback,
            "thought_process": "Received feedback from Critic Tool."
        },
        ""
    )

    if critic_status == "pass":
        break  # Success!

    # Attempt to revise the structure based on feedback
    revised, new_structure = attempt_revision(current_structure, critic_feedback)

    Append_Agent_Log(
        "Script Architecture",
        "revision_attempt",
        {
            "iteration": iteration + 1,
            "attempted_revision": revised,
            "thought_process": "Attempted revision based on Critic Tool feedback."
        },
        ""
    )

    if not revised:
        Append_Agent_Log(
            "Script Architecture",
            "end_processing",
            {
                "iteration": iteration + 1,
                "termination_reason": "no_revision_possible",
                "last_critic_feedback": critic_feedback,
                "thought_process": "No further revisions possible; stopping."
            },
            ""
        )
        break

    current_structure = new_structure
    iteration += 1

if iteration == MAX_ITERATIONS and critic_status != "pass":
    Append_Agent_Log(
        "Script Architecture",
        "end_processing",
        {
            "iteration": iteration,
            "termination_reason": "max_iterations",
            "last_critic_feedback": last_critic_feedback,
            "thought_process": "Max iterations reached without passing Critic Tool."
        },
        ""
    )
```

---

## Key Points

- **Log at the start of each iteration** (with the iteration number).
- **Log every Critic Tool call and its full feedback.**
- **Log every revision attempt** (and whether a revision was actually made).
- **Log the reason for stopping** (max iterations, no revision possible, or pass).
- **Include the last Critic Tool feedback in the final log.**

---

## How to Use

- Place these logs at the corresponding points in your agent’s revision loop.
- Adjust the function names and data structures to match your actual implementation.
- This will give you a clear, step-by-step trace of what happened at each iteration.

---

Would you like a version in another language, or help mapping this to your actual codebase? If you share your loop or agent code, I can tailor the snippet even more closely!

---

_**User**_

Why are you writing javascript?

---

_**Assistant**_

Great catch! The logging function in your documentation is shown in a **JavaScript-like pseudo-signature** (e.g., `Append Agent Log(...)`), but your actual agent code is likely written in **Python** (or another language), especially if you’re using LLM orchestration frameworks or n8n custom agents.

### Why I Used JavaScript-Like Syntax

- The **ScriptArchitecture.md** documentation provides logging instructions in a JavaScript-style function signature for clarity and universality, not as an implementation requirement.
- The actual agent code (the logic that runs the revision loop and calls the Critic Tool) is almost always written in Python or TypeScript, depending on your stack.

### What You Should Do

- **Implement the logging in your agent’s actual language** (likely Python).
- The code snippet I provided is in Python, except for the logging function name, which matches your documentation for clarity.
- You should replace `Append_Agent_Log(...)` with your real logging function or API call, using the correct syntax for your language.

---

## Example: Python Logging Call

If your agent is in Python, your logging might look like this:

```python
def append_agent_log(agent_name, event_type, event_data, segment_label):
    # Your actual logging implementation here
    # For example, write to a file, database, or n8n log node
    pass

# Usage in the loop:
append_agent_log(
    "Script Architecture",
    "revision_iteration",
    {
        "iteration": iteration + 1,
        "thought_process": f"Starting revision iteration {iteration + 1}."
    },
    ""
)
```

---

## Summary

- The **JavaScript-style** logging function in your docs is for **specification**, not implementation.
- **Implement the logging in your agent’s actual language** (likely Python).
- The **revision loop snippet** I provided is Pythonic, and you should adapt the logging calls to your real logging mechanism.

---

If you share a snippet of your actual agent code (especially the revision loop and logging), I can give you a drop-in Python example tailored to your codebase!

---

_**User**_

That may be part opf the problem. We don't use Javascript in the critic to log at all and it works quite well.

Change the logging of the architect to follow the logging style of the critic.

To align the **Script Architecture Agent's logging** with the **Critic's logging style**, you should:

### 1. **Adopt the Critic's Logging Structure**
- **Always call the Logging Tool with four arguments:**
  - `agent_name` (always "Script Architecture")
  - `event_type` (e.g., "start_processing", "segmentation_decision", "tool_usage", "field_validation", "end_processing", etc.)
  - `event_data` (a JSON object with at least a `message` and an `input` field)
  - `segment_label` (the full hierarchical path, or "" for top-level events)

- **event_data** should always include:
  - `message`: a brief, human-readable description of the event
  - `input`: the minimal relevant context (e.g., the segment being processed, or the fields/values being validated or changed)

### 2. **Remove JavaScript-style pseudo-calls and use only structured logging calls**
- No code block formatting, no pseudo-function signatures—just structured tool calls in your agent's actual language (likely Python).

### 3. **Example Logging Calls (Python-style pseudo-code):**

```python
# Start of processing
log_event(
    agent_name="Script Architecture",
    event_type="start_processing",
    event_data={
        "message": "Started processing raw narration script",
        "input": {"script_summary": "First 100 chars: ..."}
    },
    segment_label=""
)

# After a segmentation decision
log_event(
    agent_name="Script Architecture",
    event_type="segmentation_decision",
    event_data={
        "message": "Segmented act-1 into 3 sequences",
        "input": {"level": "act", "label": "act-1", "segments": ["seq-1", "seq-2", "seq-3"]}
    },
    segment_label="act-1"
)

# After tool usage
log_event(
    agent_name="Script Architecture",
    event_type="tool_usage",
    event_data={
        "message": "Calculated word count for scene-2_shot-1",
        "input": {"level": "shot", "label": "scene-2_shot-1", "word_count": 14}
    },
    segment_label="scene-2_shot-1"
)

# On validation failure
log_event(
    agent_name="Script Architecture",
    event_type="field_validation",
    event_data={
        "message": "Shot exceeds max word count",
        "input": {"level": "shot", "label": "scene-2_shot-1", "word_count": 22, "limit": 15}
    },
    segment_label="scene-2_shot-1"
)

# End of processing
log_event(
    agent_name="Script Architecture",
    event_type="end_processing",
    event_data={
        "message": "Completed hierarchical structure and output JSON",
        "input": {"summary": "2 acts, 5 sequences, 12 scenes, 28 shots"}
    },
    segment_label=""
)
```

---

## **How to Update Your Agent**

- **Replace all logging calls** in the Script Architecture Agent with this four-argument, Critic-style structure.
- **event_data** should always have a `message` and an `input` field, with `input` containing only the minimal relevant context (not the whole structure unless necessary).
- **No JavaScript pseudo-calls** or code block formatting—just structured tool calls in your agent's actual language.

---

## **Summary Table: Logging Style Comparison**

| Aspect                | Old Architect Style                | Critic Style (Recommended)         |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Function Signature    | Pseudo-JS, 4 args, sometimes code block | 4 args, always structured, no code block |
| event_data            | `thought_process`, `decisions`, etc. | `message`, `input` (minimal context) |
| Output Format         | Sometimes code block or pseudo-call | Never code block, just tool call   |
| Consistency           | Inconsistent, sometimes verbose    | Always concise, minimal, structured|
| Example               | See above                          | See above                          |

---

**Would you like a drop-in Python function for this logging style, or a patch for your agent code?** If you share your current logging function, I can provide a direct replacement!

---

_**User**_

Why are you talking about python?

---

_**Assistant**_

Thank you for pointing that out!  
I referenced Python because many LLM-based agents and workflow automations (including n8n custom agents, LangChain, etc.) are often implemented in Python, and you mentioned “code snippet” earlier, which is a common request for Python code.

**However, the key point is not the language, but the logging structure and style.**  
The Critic agent’s logging style is language-agnostic and is about:

- Always calling the Logging Tool with four arguments:  
  `agent_name`, `event_type`, `event_data` (with `message` and `input`), and `segment_label`
- Ensuring `event_data.input` contains only the minimal relevant context
- Never using pseudo-code, markdown code blocks, or JavaScript-style signatures in the logs

**You should implement this logging style in whatever language or workflow system your Script Architecture Agent is actually written in** (n8n, TypeScript, JavaScript, etc.).

---

### The Takeaway

- **Ignore the language in my examples**—the important part is the structure and content of the log calls.
- **Apply the Critic’s logging conventions** (as described above) in your agent’s actual implementation language or workflow.

If you tell me what language or platform your Script Architecture Agent is actually implemented in (e.g., n8n JSON, TypeScript, JavaScript, etc.), I can give you a concrete example in that language!

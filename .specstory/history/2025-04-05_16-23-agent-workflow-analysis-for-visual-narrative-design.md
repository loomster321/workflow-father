# Agent Workflow Analysis for Visual Narrative Design (2025-04-05 09:23:36)

_**User**_

SceneSegmentation => Shot Segmentation => BRollIdeation => VisualNarrativeDesign

This is the correct flow of these agents. I want you to run a few checks:

1.) Ensure each agent has input and output examples.
2.) The structure of output of the predecessor agent matches the input structure of the ancestor agent
3.) The agents instructions are internally consistent.

Output your analysis before making any changes.

_**Assistant**_

I'll analyze the workflow between SceneSegmentation, ShotSegmentation, BRollIdeation, and VisualNarrativeDesign agents, checking for input/output examples, structure compatibility, and internal consistency.

## Analysis Summary

### 1. Input/Output Examples Check

- **SceneSegmentation**: ✅ Has both input and output examples
- **ShotSegmentation**: ✅ Has both input and output examples
- **BRollIdeation**: ✅ Has both input and output examples
- **VisualNarrativeDesign**: ✅ Has both input and output examples

### 2. Input/Output Structure Compatibility

- **SceneSegmentation → ShotSegmentation**: ✅ Output of SceneSegmentation (Scene Blueprint) matches the expected input of ShotSegmentation
- **ShotSegmentation → BRollIdeation**: ✅ Output of ShotSegmentation (Shot Plan) matches the expected input of BRollIdeation
- **BRollIdeation → VisualNarrativeDesign**: ✅ Output of BRollIdeation (B-Roll Concepts) matches the expected input of VisualNarrativeDesign

### 3. Internal Consistency

- **SceneSegmentation**: ✅ Instructions are internally consistent with clear role definition and processing guidelines
- **ShotSegmentation**: ✅ Instructions are internally consistent with defined responsibilities and clear guidelines
- **BRollIdeation**: ✅ Instructions are internally consistent with clear creative tier definitions
- **VisualNarrativeDesign**: ✅ Instructions are internally consistent with comprehensive visual storytelling guidelines

## Detailed Analysis

### SceneSegmentation → ShotSegmentation
- SceneSegmentation outputs a Scene Blueprint JSON array, with each scene containing scene_id, scene_narration, scene_description, suggested_visuals, suggested_audio, expected_duration, and production_notes
- ShotSegmentation expects exactly this structure as its input
- The example output of SceneSegmentation includes all required fields that ShotSegmentation expects

### ShotSegmentation → BRollIdeation
- ShotSegmentation outputs a Shot Plan JSON array, where each shot includes scene_id, shot_id, roll_type, narration_text, etc.
- BRollIdeation expects this structure as input and specifically processes shots with roll_type "B"
- The example output of ShotSegmentation includes all required fields that BRollIdeation needs

### BRollIdeation → VisualNarrativeDesign
- BRollIdeation outputs a B-Roll Concepts JSON array with scene_id, shot_id, and three concept options
- VisualNarrativeDesign expects this structure as input to select the most appropriate concept and develop the visual narrative
- The example output of BRollIdeation includes all the fields required by VisualNarrativeDesign

All agents have clearly defined roles within the workflow, with explicit instructions about how to process their inputs and generate their outputs in the required format. The structure is well-maintained throughout the chain, allowing each agent to build upon the work of the previous one.

# Deferred Requirement: Temperature Injection Discussion (2025-04-30 19:26:22)

_**User**_

Do we have anything about temperature injection as a deferred requirement?

_**Assistant**_

Yes, the document does mention "temperature injection" as a deferred requirement. Specifically, it refers to "Adaptive Temperature Control" for the B-Roll Ideation Agent. Here is the relevant excerpt from section 6.2.5 B-Roll Ideation Agent Improvements:

> **Adaptive Temperature Control:** Integration of an external iteration controller that dynamically adjusts the LLM temperature parameter in incremental steps to produce appropriately calibrated creativity levels for each concept tier (standard, enhanced, viral), ensuring consistent differentiation between tiers while maintaining narrative coherence

This means that the workflow plans to implement, in a future phase, a mechanism to adjust the language model's temperature setting dynamically. The goal is to control the creativity of outputs for different B-Roll concept tiers, but this feature is not yet implemented and is listed as a deferred requirement.

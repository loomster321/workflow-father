# Reviewing Photorealism Best Practices (2025-04-05 11:47:57)

_**User**_

OK now I want you to review the best practices for photorealism document. Do you see anything important that you may have missed in this agent?

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll review the best practices for photorealism document and compare it with the MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent instructions.

---

Could not find file 'markdown:references/midjourney_photorealistic_guide.md' in the workspace.

---

Read file: references/midjourney_photorealistic_guide.md

---

After reviewing the photorealism guide, I've identified several important elements missing or underdeveloped in the MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent instructions:

1. **Natural Language Flow** - The agent doesn't emphasize using conversational, grammatically correct sentences instead of keyword lists. This helps create more coherent and natural-looking images.

2. **Seed Management** - The guide mentions using `--seed` for consistency when testing incremental changes, but the agent doesn't provide specific information about seed value ranges (0-4294967295).

3. **Prompt Length Management** - The agent lacks guidance on avoiding prompt overload, specifically the recommendation to limit prompts to ~7 key concepts to prevent "token loss."

4. **Common Pitfalls** - The guide identifies specific mistakes to avoid:
   - Overloading with too many competing concepts
   - Using vague descriptors like "beautiful" or "amazing"
   - Including conflicting instructions
   - Over-relying on camera names without sufficient lighting/composition details

5. **Special Effects Techniques**:
   - Text integration technique (enclosing desired text in quotes)
   - Specific material rendering techniques for challenging textures like glass, water, and metal

6. **Template Structure** - While the agent has a structured approach, it could benefit from the more comprehensive template:
   [Subject] + [Action/Pose] + [Environment] + [Time of Day] + [Camera Settings] + [Lighting] + [Style Parameters]

7. **Iterative Approach** - The guide recommends starting with simple prompts and using Midjourney's Remix Mode to refine outputs based on initial results.

8. **Aspect Ratio Specificity** - The guide suggests using ratios that match real camera formats (3:2 for DSLR, 9:16 for phone camera) rather than just defaulting to 16:9.

These additions would enhance the agent's ability to create more photorealistic and effective MidJourney prompts.

---

_**User**_

I agree with all of these recommendations except with 7 & 8 as follows:

7. The iteraive approach using remix makes sense form a quality perspective, but it also complicates the workflow introducing more review steps. I want you to document a deferred requirement in the workflow document.
8. The aspect ratio needs to stay at 16:9 because of the output video format. 

Please make the changes with my caveats as described.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the agent guidelines to incorporate your feedback, adding the iterative approach as a deferred requirement while keeping the aspect ratio at 16:9.

---

Read file: MidJourneyPromptEngineering.md

---

```diff
  - Always use `--style raw` to minimize artistic interpretation
  - Set appropriate stylization value (typically 750 for balanced detail)
- - Match aspect ratio to the project requirements (16:9)
+ - Use `--ar 16:9` for all prompts to match the video output format requirements
  
  ### 3. Technical Parameter Implementation
  
  Always include these technical parameters:
  
- - `--ar 16:9` for standard video format (or as specified in `technical_requirements`)
+ - `--ar 16:9` for standard video format (required for all prompts)
  - `--style raw` for photorealism
  - `--stylize 750` for balanced detail level
     - Apply the project's `technical_requirements` (aspect ratio, resolution guidelines)
     - Include appropriate technical parameters
-    - Ensure aspect ratio is set to match the technical_requirements (default 16:9 unless otherwise specified)
+    - Ensure aspect ratio is set to 16:9 for all prompts to match video output requirements
     - Verify prompt follows MidJourney's optimal syntax
  
  - Include version tracking for iteration management
  - Confirm that technical specifications match the project's technical_requirements
+ 
+ ## Prompt Length Management
+ 
+ - Limit prompts to approximately 7 key concepts to prevent "token loss" where important details are overlooked
+ - Focus on the most important visual elements rather than trying to include every possible detail
+ - Use concise, descriptive language rather than repetitive or redundant terms 
+ - Maintain grammatically correct sentences rather than keyword lists for more natural results
+ - Prioritize elements based on their importance to the shot's narrative function
+ 
+ ## Special Effects Techniques
+ 
+ ### Text Integration
+ 
+ For including text in images:
+ - Enclose desired text in quotes (e.g., "Welcome" on a neon sign)
+ - Use simple, clear typography instructions
+ 
+ ### Specific Materials
+ 
+ For particularly challenging textures like glass, water, or metal, reference both the material and its behavior:
+ - "Crystal clear water reflecting sunlight with subtle ripples"
+ - "Brushed stainless steel with subtle fingerprint smudges"
+ 
+ ## Deferred Requirements
+ 
+ The following advanced techniques are noted as deferred requirements for future implementation:
+ 
+ 1. **Iterative Approach with MidJourney Remix Mode**: While using an iterative approach with MidJourney's Remix Mode would potentially improve image quality by starting with simple prompts and gradually refining outputs based on initial results, this approach has been deferred as it would introduce additional review steps and complexity to the current workflow.
+ 
+ 2. **Expanded Template System**: Development of a comprehensive library of reusable prompt components (lighting setups, camera profiles, common subjects) to maintain consistency is deferred for future implementation.
  
  ## Output Requirements
  7. Adapt prompt construction to meet the specific needs of each shot
  8. Apply technical specifications from the Visual Narrative's technical_requirements section
+ 9. Always use 16:9 aspect ratio for all prompts as required by the video output format
  
```

---

Now I'll check if there's a need to update the workflow document to reflect this deferred requirement.

```

---

I've made the following updates:

1. Modified the MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent instructions by:
   - Ensuring aspect ratio is consistently set to 16:9 (not just matching technical requirements)
   - Adding sections on prompt length management and special effects techniques
   - Adding a "Deferred Requirements" section that explicitly marks the iterative approach with MidJourney's Remix Mode as deferred due to workflow complexity
   - Adding a specific output requirement to always use 16:9 aspect ratio

2. Updated the main workflow document (Video-Production-WF-ver-2.2.html) by:
   - Adding the deferred requirement about MidJourney's Remix Mode to section 6.2

These changes preserve the technical benefits and best practices from the photorealism guide while addressing your concerns about workflow complexity and maintaining the required 16:9 aspect ratio for the output video format.

_**User**_

Please consolidate all the deferred requirements in the workflow document to avoid redundancy and inconsistencies.

```

I've consolidated the deferred requirements in the workflow document to create a more consistent, comprehensive list that:

1. Combines related requirements from both the main workflow document and the MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent instructions
2. Adds clear, descriptive titles to each requirement (in bold) for better readability and reference
3. Provides consistent formatting and level of detail across all requirements
4. Includes the "Prompt Template System" from the MidJourney agent instructions that wasn't previously in the main workflow document
5. Improves descriptions to better explain the purpose and benefits of each deferred feature
6. Maintains proper alignment with the MidJourney-specific requirements that were added in our previous update

The consolidated list now presents a more professional, organized view of future implementation plans without redundancy or inconsistency. Each requirement is clearly categorized and described, making it easier for implementation teams to understand the scope and purpose of future enhancements.

---

_**User**_

OK but I still see the deferred requirements in the agent. This wastes tokens and creates confusion with redundant requirements in the workflow.

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right. Let me fix that by removing the redundant deferred requirements section from the MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent instructions, as these are now properly consolidated in the main workflow document.

---

```diff
  - "Crystal clear water reflecting sunlight with subtle ripples"
  - "Brushed stainless steel with subtle fingerprint smudges"

```

---

I've removed the redundant "Deferred Requirements" section from the MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent instructions. This change:

1. Eliminates duplication between the agent instructions and the main workflow document
2. Reduces token usage, making the agent instructions more efficient
3. Prevents potential confusion or inconsistencies if the requirements get updated in one place but not the other
4. Centralizes all deferred requirements in a single location (section 6.2 of the main workflow document)

The main workflow document now serves as the single source of truth for all deferred requirements, including the MidJourney-specific ones, which are properly integrated and consolidated in section 6.2. This approach is more maintainable and eliminates the risk of conflicting information as the project evolves.

---

_**User**_

OK now I want you to review the best practices for photorealism document one last time. Do you now see anything important that you may have missed in this agent?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me review the photorealism guide document one more time to check for any important elements that might still be missing from the MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent.

---

Read file: references/midjourney_photorealistic_guide.md

---

Read file: MidJourneyPromptEngineering.md

---

After reviewing the photorealism guide document and comparing it with the current MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent, I notice a few elements that could still be incorporated:

1. **Common Pitfalls Section**: The agent is missing a dedicated section on common pitfalls to avoid, which is in the photorealism guide. Specifically:
   - Warning about conflicting instructions (e.g., "vintage and futuristic")
   - Caution against over-reliance on camera names without descriptive lighting and composition
   - The dangers of overloading prompts with too many competing concepts

2. **Example Prompt Library Diversity**: While the agent has good examples, it lacks examples for product photography and architectural interiors, which are included in the photorealism guide's example library.

3. **Natural Language Flow Emphasis**: Although the agent mentions using grammatically correct sentences in the Prompt Length Management section, it could more explicitly emphasize the importance of conversational, coherent sentences over keyword lists, as highlighted in the guide's Core Principles.

4. **Additional Content-Specific Parameters**: For certain content types, there could be more specific guidance on parameter selection (like stylization values varying for different content types).

Would you like me to update the agent instructions to incorporate these missing elements?

---

_**User**_

My comments as follows:

1. Include common pitfalls.
2. product photography and architectural interiors are not relevant to this workflow so I am unclear what value these add.
3. Makes sense.
4. I need more explaination of this with examples before I can comment.

Don't update until we are clear on all changes.

---

_**Assistant**_

Thanks for your comments. Let me address each point with more clarity:

1. **Common Pitfalls**: I'll prepare a concise section highlighting key pitfalls to avoid when creating MidJourney prompts, such as conflicting instructions and overloading prompts with too many concepts.

2. **Product Photography and Architectural Interiors**: You're right - these specific example types may not be directly relevant to the video production workflow. I was suggesting additional prompt examples for completeness, but if they don't serve the core workflow purpose, they can be omitted.

3. **Natural Language Flow**: We can emphasize this more explicitly in the existing structure.

4. **Content-Specific Parameters**: Let me explain this better with examples:

   - For **Abstract Concepts**: Consider using a slightly higher stylization value (e.g., `--stylize 850` instead of 750) to enhance artistic interpretation while maintaining structure, as seen in the Abstract Tech Concept example.
   
   - For **Highly Detailed Scenes**: When creating shots with numerous small details (like a crowded cityscape), consider using `--chaos 10` to allow MidJourney to include more varied elements while maintaining overall composition.
   
   - For **Emotional Scenes**: For shots conveying strong emotions, pair appropriate stylization with lighting terminology that reinforces the emotion (e.g., for tension: "harsh directional lighting creating strong shadows across features, high contrast, shot with Canon EOS R5 (50mm f/1.8) --stylize 800").
   
   - For **Motion Suggestion**: When suggesting movement, specify camera settings that would capture that movement in real photography (e.g., "waves crashing against rocks, shot with Sony A7 (24mm f/16), 1/4 second exposure to capture water motion --stylize 750").

These parameter adjustments help fine-tune the generation process based on the specific content type and emotional qualities you're trying to achieve.

Would these additions be valuable to the agent instructions? Or would you like to adjust the scope of any of these proposed changes?

---

_**User**_

OK now I am in agreement. Include all of the suggestions in 1, 3, and 4 but exclude irrelevant prompt examples you memntioned in 2.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent with the agreed changes, incorporating points 1, 3, and 4 while excluding the irrelevant examples from point 2.

---

```diff
  - Maintain grammatically correct sentences rather than keyword lists for more natural results
  - Prioritize elements based on their importance to the shot's narrative function
+ 
+ ## Natural Language Flow
+ 
+ Always structure prompts using natural, conversational language rather than disconnected keywords or phrases:
+ 
+ - **Use Complete Sentences**: "A young professional using a holographic interface in a modern office space" instead of "young professional, holographic, modern, office"
+ - **Flow Naturally**: Build descriptions that read like coherent descriptions a photographer might use
+ - **Avoid Keyword Stacking**: Don't simply list adjectives; integrate them into meaningful descriptions
+ - **Maintain Grammatical Structure**: Proper grammar helps MidJourney understand relationships between elements 
+ 
+ Example of poor prompt structure:
+ ```
+ office worker, futuristic, blue glow, technology, advanced, professional, clean, detailed, realistic
+ ```
+ 
+ Example of improved natural language:
+ ```
+ A focused office worker interacting with a futuristic interface with subtle blue glow, in a clean professional environment with advanced technology visible in background details, shot on Canon EOS R5 with natural lighting from large windows --style raw --ar 16:9 --stylize 750
+ ```
  
  ## Special Effects Techniques
  - "Crystal clear water reflecting sunlight with subtle ripples"
  - "Brushed stainless steel with subtle fingerprint smudges"
+ 
+ ## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
+ 
+ 1. **Conflicting Instructions**: Avoid contradictory elements in the same prompt (e.g., "vintage and futuristic interface" or "minimalist design with intricate details"). Choose one clear direction.
+ 
+ 2. **Overloading with Concepts**: Too many competing ideas dilute the final result and create confusion. Focus on the most important 5-7 key elements.
+ 
+ 3. **Vague Descriptors**: Terms like "beautiful," "amazing," or "professional quality" add little value. Replace with specific visual characteristics.
+ 
+ 4. **Over-reliance on Camera Names**: While camera equipment terminology helps signal photorealism, balance with thorough descriptions of lighting, composition, and atmosphere.
+ 
+ 5. **Inconsistent Style Parameters**: Ensure `--style raw` and appropriate stylization values are used consistently across related shots for visual coherence.
+ 
+ 6. **Neglecting Environmental Context**: Always include environment/setting information, even for close-up shots, to provide context and grounding.
+ 
+ ## Content-Specific Parameter Guidelines
+ 
+ Adjust technical parameters based on the specific content type and creative intent:
+ 
+ ### For Abstract Concepts
+ ```
+ "Neural network visualization as an ethereal galaxy of interconnected nodes, glowing blue-violet connections between crystalline data points, cosmic-scale perspective with floating fragments of code, otherworldly lighting from within the structure, shot with ultra-wide lens to capture the expansive scale --ar 16:9 --stylize 850"
+ ```
+ - Use higher stylization values (800-900) to enhance artistic interpretation
+ - Consider omitting `--style raw` for more creative interpretations
+ - Embrace metaphorical and conceptual language
+ 
+ ### For Highly Detailed Scenes
+ ```
+ "Bustling innovation lab with engineers working on multiple holographic screens, complex equipment throughout the space, morning light streaming through large windows, central focal point on lead researcher gesturing at main display, shot on Sony FX6 with 24mm lens, deep focus to capture environmental details --style raw --ar 16:9 --stylize 750 --chaos 15"
+ ```
+ - Use `--chaos` parameter (10-30) to allow more varied elements while maintaining composition
+ - Maintain `--stylize` at moderate values (700-800) for detail clarity
+ - Include specific depth of field instructions (deep focus, f/8-f/16)
+ 
+ ### For Emotional Scenes
+ ```
+ "Executive making difficult decision, shoulders slightly slumped, dramatic low-key lighting creating strong shadows across features, tension visible in facial expression, soft blue ambient light from computer screen, shot with Canon EOS R5 (50mm f/1.8), shallow depth of field isolating subject against darkened office --style raw --ar 16:9 --stylize 800"
+ ```
+ - Match stylization value to emotional intensity (higher for stronger emotions)
+ - Pair with appropriate lighting terminology that reinforces the emotion
+ - Include specific physical cues that convey the emotional state
+ 
+ ### For Suggesting Motion
+ ```
+ "Developer gesturing to expand a holographic interface, motion blur on hands showing rapid movement, interface elements leaving light trails as they respond, dynamic composition with directional energy, shot with Sony A7 (35mm f/2.8), 1/15 second exposure to capture movement while maintaining environmental clarity --style raw --ar 16:9 --stylize 750"
+ ```
+ - Reference photographic techniques that capture motion (slower shutter speeds, motion blur)
+ - Use directional terms to indicate movement paths
+ - Include terminology about energy and flow to enhance dynamic qualities
  
  ## Output Requirements
```

I've updated the MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent with the improvements we agreed upon:

1. **Added a dedicated "Natural Language Flow" section** that:
   - Emphasizes the importance of conversational, coherent sentences over disconnected keywords
   - Provides clear contrasting examples of poor vs. effective prompt structure
   - Explains the benefits of proper grammatical structure for AI comprehension
   - Offers concrete examples of how to transform keyword lists into natural language descriptions

2. **Added a "Common Pitfalls to Avoid" section** that warns against:
   - Conflicting instructions within prompts
   - Overloading with too many competing concepts
   - Using vague descriptors instead of specific visual characteristics
   - Over-relying on camera names without supporting details
   - Using inconsistent style parameters across related shots
   - Neglecting environmental context even in close-up shots

3. **Added "Content-Specific Parameter Guidelines"** with examples tailored to the workflow:
   - Abstract Concepts (like data visualizations, neural networks)
   - Highly Detailed Scenes (like innovation labs, complex environments)
   - Emotional Scenes (showcasing human emotional states)
   - Motion Suggestions (techniques for implying movement in static images)

Each section includes relevant examples that directly relate to the kinds of content likely to be featured in the workflow's videos, while avoiding irrelevant examples like product photography and architectural interiors.

These additions should significantly improve the quality and consistency of the prompts generated by the agent while maintaining focus on the specific needs of the Video Production Workflow.

---

_**User**_

Do you have any more observations?

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the overall MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent after all our updates, I have a few additional observations:

1. **Code Block Format**: I see the user made syntax highlighting adjustments to the code blocks by adding `text` to the code fence markers. This is a good change for documentation readability.

2. **Parameter Consistency**: While we've covered aspect ratio consistency (16:9) well, we could reinforce the message about consistently using `--style raw` for photorealistic shots. The abstract concepts section mentions potentially omitting it, but we should clarify when this is appropriate.

3. **Image Generation Speed**: We don't currently mention how parameter choices affect generation time and complexity. For workflow efficiency, it might be helpful to note which parameters (like high chaos values) could potentially increase generation time.

4. **Troubleshooting Tips**: We could add brief guidance on what to adjust first when an initial prompt doesn't produce satisfactory results (e.g., adjusting stylization before changing major content elements).

5. **Parameter Ordering**: While we discuss parameter usage, we don't explicitly mention that parameter order matters for consistency (e.g., always putting `--style raw` before `--ar 16:9` before `--stylize 750`).

6. **Prompt Testing Strategy**: The document could benefit from brief guidance on how to develop and test prompts in a structured way, even without the full iterative approach that was deferred.

These are relatively minor points compared to the substantial improvements we've already made. The agent instructions are now quite comprehensive and should provide excellent guidance for generating high-quality MidJourney prompts within the workflow.

---

_**User**_

I don't care about generation time. The other points I agree with but I would like a better explaination of how 6 would work in practice.

---

_**Assistant**_

Regarding point #6 about a prompt testing strategy, here's a more detailed explanation of how it would work in practice:

A structured prompt testing approach (even without full Remix Mode iteration) would involve:

1. **Start with Core Elements**: Begin by constructing a prompt with just the essential elements:
   - Primary subject with key attributes
   - Basic setting/environment 
   - Core technical parameters (--style raw --ar 16:9 --stylize 750)

2. **Strategic Variation**: If the initial result needs improvement, make targeted changes in this specific order:
   - First: Adjust technical parameters (stylization value, chaos level)
   - Second: Enhance descriptive language for key elements
   - Third: Add or refine lighting and atmosphere specifications
   - Fourth: Modify camera and lens specifications

3. **Reference Banking**: Document which specific prompt elements work well for particular visual needs. For example:
   - "Holographic elements respond best to 'translucent blue interfaces with subtle inner glow'"
   - "Executive portraits achieve optimal realism with 'Canon EOS R5 with 85mm portrait lens at f/2.0'"

4. **Parameter Isolation**: When troubleshooting, change only one major prompt component at a time. For instance:
   - If a scene lacks detail, only adjust the stylization value first
   - If composition is wrong, focus only on changing camera specifications

5. **Seed Utilization**: When appropriate, use the seed value from a partially successful generation as a starting point for a refined prompt to maintain good elements while improving others

This structured approach allows for methodical prompt improvement without requiring the full iterative capabilities of Remix Mode, helping maintain efficiency in the workflow while still improving results when needed.

Would you like me to incorporate this explanation into the document as a new section?

---

_**User**_

In regard to Reference Banking, how would one determine which specific prompt elements work well for particular visual needs?

---

_**Assistant**_

Reference Banking would work through a process of systematic observation and documentation of results. Here's how you would determine which specific prompt elements work well:

1. **Outcome Analysis**: When a generated image successfully captures a specific visual element (like a holographic interface or executive portrait), note the exact phrasing used in that part of the prompt.

2. **Pattern Recognition**: Look for recurring language patterns across multiple successful images with similar visual elements. For example, you might notice that "translucent blue interfaces with geometric patterns" consistently produces better holographic elements than "holographic blue screens."

3. **Comparison Documentation**: When multiple prompts are created for similar shots, document which specific phrasings produced the best results. Create simple A/B comparisons like:
   - More effective: "translucent blue interfaces with subtle inner glow"
   - Less effective: "holographic blue UI elements"

4. **Technical Parameter Correlation**: Track which technical specifications (camera models, lens settings) consistently produce the desired aesthetic for specific types of shots.

5. **Visual Element Libraries**: Organize these insights by visual category:
   - Technology elements (interfaces, devices, displays)
   - Human elements (expressions, poses, interactions)
   - Environmental elements (office spaces, home environments)
   - Lighting conditions (by mood and setting)

6. **Contextual Effectiveness**: Note when certain descriptors work better in specific contexts. For example, "Canon EOS R5 with 85mm lens at f/2.0" might work excellently for executive portraits but not for wide technology scenes.

This approach creates a growing knowledge base of effective prompt elements without requiring full Remix Mode iteration, allowing for more efficient prompt creation in future shots. It functions similar to how a professional photographer might maintain mental notes of which camera settings and composition techniques work best for specific subjects.

Would you like me to add this explanation as a new section in the document to provide clearer guidance on implementing prompt testing strategies?

---

_**User**_

Hmm that sounds a lot like what the Midjourney moodboard does. Are you recreating functionality which already exists?

---

_**Assistant**_

You're making an excellent point. Reference Banking does sound similar to what MidJourney's moodboard already provides - a way to collect and reference successful examples.

You're right that we shouldn't recreate existing functionality. The moodboard already allows users to:
- Save successful images as reference points
- Group related visual styles together
- Use these as starting points for new prompts
- Compare different approaches side-by-side

Rather than implementing a parallel reference system, a better approach would be to leverage MidJourney's existing moodboard functionality as part of the workflow when appropriate, while focusing our prompt testing strategy on systematic parameter adjustments and structured experimentation.

The structured prompt testing approach should emphasize the methodical adjustment of parameters and language elements, without trying to duplicate the visual reference capabilities that MidJourney already provides through its moodboard feature.

Would you prefer I develop a more streamlined prompt testing strategy that complements rather than recreates MidJourney's existing capabilities?

---

_**User**_

Yes simpler is better in this case. Implement the changes we agreed but summarize before you proceed so I can double check.

---

_**Assistant**_

Here's a summary of the changes we've agreed to implement:

1. **Add Parameter Consistency**: Reinforce consistent use of `--style raw` for photorealistic shots, with clear guidance on when it might be omitted (e.g., for certain abstract concepts).

2. **Add Parameter Ordering**: Include explicit guidance on the correct ordering of parameters (e.g., `--style raw` before `--ar 16:9` before `--stylize 750`) for consistency.

3. **Add Streamlined Prompt Testing Strategy**: Create a concise section with a methodical approach for testing and improving prompts without duplicating MidJourney's moodboard functionality. This will focus on:
   - Starting with core elements
   - Making targeted changes in a specific order
   - Changing only one major component at a time
   - Using seed values strategically

4. **Add Troubleshooting Tips**: Brief guidance on what to adjust first when initial prompts don't produce satisfactory results.

These changes will provide practical process guidance while avoiding redundancy with MidJourney's existing features. 

Does this summary accurately reflect the changes you'd like to see?

---

_**User**_

Hmm looks like you missed some things that you mentioned before like seed values and strategic variations and maybe others.

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right - I need to be more thorough. I've mentioned several elements that didn't get added to the document. Here's a complete summary of all the changes we should implement:

1. **Parameter Consistency**: Reinforce consistent use of `--style raw` for photorealistic shots, with clear guidance on when it might be omitted.

2. **Parameter Ordering**: Include explicit guidance on the correct ordering of parameters for consistency.

3. **Prompt Testing Strategy**: A structured approach for methodically testing and improving prompts without duplicating MidJourney's moodboard functionality, including:
   - Strategic variations in a specific order
   - Seed value usage
   - One-change-at-a-time testing methodology
   - Practical troubleshooting steps

4. **Troubleshooting Tips**: Specific guidance on what to adjust first when initial prompts don't produce satisfactory results.

Let me implement these changes comprehensively, ensuring we don't miss any of the elements we discussed.

```diff
  - Include terminology about energy and flow to enhance dynamic qualities
  ```
+ 
+ ## Parameter Consistency and Ordering
+ 
+ ### Style Parameter Consistency
+ 
+ - **For Photorealistic Content**: Always use `--style raw` to minimize artistic interpretation and maximize realism. This includes portraits, corporate settings, realistic technology interfaces, and documentary-style shots.
+ 
+ - **For Abstract or Artistic Content**: Consider omitting `--style raw` only when creating highly conceptual visuals like data visualizations, abstract technology representations, or stylized mood-based imagery.
+ 
+ - **Mixed-Reality Content**: When showing realistic humans interacting with fantastical elements (like holographic interfaces), retain `--style raw` to keep human elements photorealistic while describing the fantastical elements with enhanced creative language.
+ 
+ ### Parameter Order
+ 
+ Always place parameter flags in this specific order for consistency and optimal processing:
+ 
+ ``` text
+ [prompt text content] --style raw --ar 16:9 --stylize [value] --chaos [value] --seed [value]
+ ```
+ 
+ Where:
+ - Style specification always comes first
+ - Aspect ratio always follows style
+ - Stylization value always follows aspect ratio
+ - Chaos and seed values (when used) always come last
+ 
+ This consistent ordering helps maintain prompt readability and ensures consistent processing by MidJourney.
+ 
+ ## Prompt Testing Strategy
+ 
+ Apply this structured approach when refining prompts to efficiently improve results without requiring iterative Remix Mode:
+ 
+ ### 1. Core Prompt Construction
+ 
+ Begin with essential elements in this specific structure:
+ - Primary subject with key attributes
+ - Basic setting/environment
+ - Core technical parameters (`--style raw --ar 16:9 --stylize 750`)
+ 
+ Example core prompt:
+ ``` text
+ "Executive analyzing holographic data, modern office environment with city view --style raw --ar 16:9 --stylize 750"
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 2. Strategic Variation Hierarchy
+ 
+ If the initial result needs improvement, make targeted changes in this specific order:
+ 
+ 1. **First: Adjust Technical Parameters**
+    - Change stylization value in increments of 50 (e.g., 750 ‚Üí 800)
+    - Add or adjust chaos value for compositional variation
+    - Note the seed value from any partially successful generation
+ 
+ 2. **Second: Enhance Descriptive Language**
+    - Add more specific details about the primary subject
+    - Include more precise environmental descriptions
+    - Add material properties and textures
+ 
+ 3. **Third: Refine Lighting and Atmosphere**
+    - Specify more precise lighting conditions
+    - Add mood and atmospheric elements
+    - Include time of day if relevant
+ 
+ 4. **Fourth: Modify Camera Specifications**
+    - Adjust lens specifications for different framing
+    - Change camera model if needed
+    - Modify depth of field settings
+ 
+ ### 3. Seed Value Utilization
+ 
+ When a generation produces some desirable qualities but needs refinement:
+ 
+ - Note the seed value from the output (found in the MidJourney interface)
+ - Use the same seed with modified prompt elements to maintain good aspects while improving others
+ - Include the seed value at the end of your prompt using `--seed [value]` format
+ 
+ Example of seed usage:
+ ``` text
+ "Executive analyzing holographic data, modern office with panoramic city view, afternoon sunlight creating diagonal light beams across space, confident posture, detailed holographic UI elements in blue, shot on Canon R5 with 35mm lens at f/4 --style raw --ar 16:9 --stylize 800 --seed 1234567"
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 4. One-Change Testing Method
+ 
+ When troubleshooting, change only one major component at a time:
+ - Modify only the stylization value first
+ - Then only adjust descriptive language
+ - Then only change camera specifications
+ - Document the impact of each isolated change
+ 
+ This methodical approach allows for systematic prompt improvement without requiring multiple feedback loops while maintaining workflow efficiency.
+ 
+ ## Troubleshooting Tips
+ 
+ When initial prompts don't produce satisfactory results, use these targeted approaches to address specific issues:
+ 
+ ### Issue: Lack of Detail
+ 
+ - Increase stylization value (try 800-850)
+ - Add more specific material descriptions and textures
+ - Add precise lighting terminology (e.g., "directional lighting emphasizing surface details")
+ - Specify a higher-end camera model with known detail reproduction (e.g., "shot on Sony A7R IV")
+ 
+ ### Issue: Incorrect Composition
+ 
+ - Specify exact framing terminology ("medium close-up shot", "wide establishing shot")
+ - Include viewpoint information ("shot from slightly below eye level")
+ - Add specific lens information suited to desired composition ("16mm wide-angle lens" or "85mm portrait lens")
+ - Specify subject placement ("centered in frame" or "positioned in right third of composition")
+ 
+ ### Issue: Unrealistic Elements
+ 
+ - Ensure `--style raw` is included
+ - Lower stylization value (try 650-700)
+ - Add more photographic terminology ("natural color grading", "photojournalistic approach")
+ - Include realistic lighting descriptors ("natural window light" rather than "glowing light")
+ - Reference specific real-world camera equipment
+ 
+ ### Issue: Inconsistent Style With Other Shots
+ 
+ - Use identical technical parameters across related shots
+ - Reuse specific successful phrases from previous shots
+ - Maintain consistent lighting terminology
+ - Reference the same camera and lens combination
+ - If a particular seed created good results in previous shots, consider using it again
+ 
+ ### Issue: Poor Character Representation
+ 
+ - Include more specific demographic details
+ - Add precise clothing descriptions
+ - Reference posture and expression clearly
+ - Ensure proper integration of character references when available
+ - Use more precise facial feature descriptions
+ 
+ Apply these targeted fixes rather than completely rewriting prompts to maintain efficiency in the workflow while systematically improving results.
  
  ## Output Requirements
```

I've now added all the missing elements to the MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent document. The comprehensive additions include:

1. **Parameter Consistency and Ordering**:
   - Clear guidance on when to use `--style raw` for different content types
   - Specific instructions on parameter ordering for consistency
   - Recommendations for mixed-reality content (humans with fantastical elements)

2. **Prompt Testing Strategy**:
   - Structured four-step approach starting with core prompt construction
   - Strategic variation hierarchy with specific order of changes
   - Seed value utilization with practical examples
   - One-change testing method to methodically improve results

3. **Troubleshooting Tips**:
   - Issue-specific solutions for common problems:
     - Lack of detail
     - Incorrect composition
     - Unrealistic elements
     - Inconsistent style between shots
     - Poor character representation
   - Targeted fixes that don't require complete prompt rewrites

These additions provide a comprehensive, practical framework for creating and refining MidJourney prompts within the workflow context, without duplicating existing MidJourney features. The approach is methodical and focuses on workflow efficiency while systematically improving results.

Is there anything else you'd like me to adjust or explain about these additions?

_**User**_

OK can you list any requirements we deferred. In parfticular I am intested in the use of moodboards to capture best examples and the remixing / iteration strategy. List any others as well.

---

_**Assistant**_

Here's a list of the requirements we've deferred:

1. **MidJourney Moodboards Integration**: Using MidJourney's native moodboard functionality to capture, organize, and reference successful prompt examples and results. This would allow for:
   - Visual collection of successful images by category
   - Easy reference for stylistic consistency across projects
   - Pattern recognition across successful prompts
   - Visual comparison of different approaches

2. **Iterative Remix Mode Approach**: Implementing a full iterative workflow using MidJourney's Remix Mode, which would include:
   - Starting with simpler prompts and gradually adding complexity
   - Using the built-in Remix feature to refine outputs based on initial results
   - Multi-step refinement cycles with human feedback
   - Progressive enhancement of promising generations

3. **Template System Development**: Creating a comprehensive library of reusable prompt components organized by:
   - Lighting setups (e.g., "three-point studio lighting with soft fill")
   - Camera profiles (e.g., "Canon EOS R5 with 85mm portrait lens at f/2.0")
   - Common subjects (e.g., "executive in business attire")
   - Environmental settings (e.g., "modern office with floor-to-ceiling windows")

4. **Advanced Seed Management System**: More sophisticated use of seed values beyond basic troubleshooting:
   - Maintaining seed databases for consistent character appearances
   - Using specific seeds known to work well with certain visual styles
   - Systematic testing of seeds for optimal results with specific prompt types

5. **A/B Testing Framework**: A structured approach to methodically test variations of:
   - Different technical parameter values
   - Alternative phrasing for similar concepts
   - Variations in prompt ordering and structure
   - Comparative analysis of results

These deferred requirements represent more complex, time-intensive approaches that would add additional steps to the workflow. Instead, we've implemented a more streamlined approach that maintains efficiency while still providing methods for systematic improvement.

_**User**_

Now I want you to review the best practices again for photorealism document one last time. Do you now see anything important that you may have missed in this agent?

---

_**Assistant**_

I should examine the photorealism guide carefully to see if there are any important techniques that haven't been incorporated into our agent.

<tool>
Tool: read_file
Arguments: {"target_file":"references/midjourney_photorealistic_guide.md","should_read_entire_file":true}
</tool>

After comparing the MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent with the photorealism guide, I notice a few important techniques that could be added:

1. **Aspect Ratio Variation**: While we've standardized on 16:9 for video output, the guide mentions how different aspect ratios can signal different camera types (e.g., 3:2 for DSLR). We could add a note about how 16:9 specifically relates to cinematic/video formats.

2. **Workflow Best Practices - Template System**: The photorealism guide describes a template system with a clear structure: [Subject] + [Action/Pose] + [Environment] + [Time of Day] + [Camera Settings] + [Lighting] + [Style Parameters]. This could be formalized in our agent for consistency.

3. **Material Behavior Descriptions**: In "Special Effects Techniques," the guide emphasizes describing not just materials but their behavior (e.g., "water reflecting sunlight with subtle ripples"). Our agent mentions materials but could be more explicit about behavior.

4. **Architectural Elements**: The example for architectural interiors shows specific language that would be valuable for office/home environments (e.g., "tilt-shift effect" for certain architectural shots).

These elements would enhance our agent by providing more specific guidance for creating truly photorealistic prompts, particularly for scenes with complex materials and architectural elements.

<user>
<user_query>
OK let's make those updates to make sure we didn't miss anything. I the aspect ratio we'll stick with 16:9 but let's make sure we adopt anything else we may have missed.
</user_query>

</user>

<assistant>
I'll update the MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent to incorporate the missing elements from the photorealism guide while keeping the 16:9 aspect ratio requirement.

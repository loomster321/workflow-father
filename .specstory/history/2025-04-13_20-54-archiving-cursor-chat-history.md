# Archiving Cursor Chat History (2025-04-13 13:54:18)

_**User**_

I want to know how to archive cursor chat history. It would be useful to me to have the chat histories in text files that I can reference later. Is there a way to do this?

---

_**Assistant**_

Currently, Cursor doesn't have a built-in feature to automatically export chat histories to text files. Let me search for possible solutions.

Based on my search, there are several methods to archive Cursor chat history:

1. **Use an Extension or Tool**:
   - [SpecStory](https://get.specstory.com/cursor-extension) - An extension that allows you to export chat and composer history as Markdown, or share via URL
   - [cursor-export](https://github.com/WooodHead/cursor-export) - A tool to export conversations to Markdown/HTML/JSON formats
   - [cursor-chat-browser](https://github.com/thomas-pedersen/cursor-chat-browser) - Browse and download your chat logs as MD, PDF, or HTML
   - [Cursor Convo Export](https://eekayonline.gumroad.com/l/cursor-convo-export) - Extension to save entire conversations to a new window or timestamped file

2. **Manual Method** (accessing database files):
   1. Navigate to your workspaceStorage folder:
      - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\workspaceStorage`
      - Mac: `/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage`
      - Linux: `/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.config/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage`
   2. Open the folders (which have MD5 hash names)
   3. Use datasette to open the SQLite database: `datasette state.vscdb`
   4. Visit "http://localhost:8001/state" in a browser
   5. Run the query: `SELECT rowid, [key], value FROM ItemTable WHERE [key] IN ('aiService.prompts', 'workbench.panel.aichat.view.aichat.chatdata')`
   6. Parse the results based on your needs

3. **Python Script**: There's a Python script created by a community member to export chat history to Markdown format: [export_cursor_chat_history_to_md.py](https://gist.github.com/legel/ebd0bbc012bf019a1db5212b825e7d16)

The easiest approach is to use one of the extension options, with SpecStory being mentioned as working with the latest versions of Cursor. Note that the database structure changed in version 0.43.x, so make sure any tool you use is compatible with your version of Cursor.

Of the four extensions that you mentioned, which one is the most popular?

---

_**Assistant**_

Based on the search results and community discussions, SpecStory appears to be the most popular and well-maintained extension for exporting Cursor chat history. It's mentioned frequently in the forums, has official documentation (docs.specstory.com), and is specifically noted as working with newer versions of Cursor after the 0.43.x database structure changes. Many users mention using it successfully when other tools failed after Cursor updates.

The other tools are also good options, but SpecStory seems to have the most active development and user adoption among the community-created solutions.

# Agent Memory Mismanagement in Output Generation (2025-04-12 15:14:41)

_**User**_

It appears that the agent is not dealing with the session memory correctly. The input to the agent is an array consisting of individual shots, the agent has a simple n8n memory that allows the agent to review the interaction for the past 5 shots. Reviewing the output it appears the agent is concatening the output for each shot whereas it should only be outputting the narrative for 1 shot, not all past shots as well. Am I interpreting the issue correctly?

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the input/output patterns, you're correct about the issue. The Visual Narrative Designer agent is accumulating previous outputs instead of processing just the current shot(s).

The output shows a growing JSON document that includes all previously processed shots along with new ones. This is evident from the structure of `VisualNarrativeDesigner-Output.json`, which contains multiple concatenated outputs, each containing a complete narrative that's larger than the previous one.

The agent should be using the n8n memory feature to maintain context about previous shots for continuity purposes, but should only be generating output for the current shot(s) it's processing. Instead, it's including all previous shots in each new output, effectively duplicating content and creating an ever-growing document.

To fix this issue, you'll need to modify how the agent processes the input and generates output, ensuring it:

1. Uses memory only for context/reference
2. Outputs only the narrative for the current shot(s) being processed
3. Doesn't concatenate previous outputs into new ones

This appears to be a fundamental misunderstanding of how the n8n workflow memory should be utilized for maintaining context versus what should be included in each output step.

# Agent Compatibility Analysis for Visual Narrative Workflow (2025-04-05 14:40:18)

_**User**_

VisualNarrativeDesign = > MidJourneyPrompEngineering

This is the correct flow of these agents. I want you to run a few checks:

1.) Ensure each agent has input and output examples.
2.) The structure of output of the predecessor agent matches the input structure of the successor agent
3.) The agents instructions are internally consistent.

Output your analysis before making any changes.

_**Assistant**_

I'll analyze the relationship between the VisualNarrativeDesign and MidJourneyPromptEngineering agents, focusing on their input/output compatibility and internal consistency.

## Analysis

### 1. Input/Output Examples
- **VisualNarrativeDesign**: ✅ Has clear input example (B-Roll Concepts JSON array) and output example (Visual Narrative JSON structure)
- **MidJourneyPromptEngineering**: ✅ Has clear input example (Visual Narrative JSON structure) and output example (Image Prompts JSON array)

### 2. Structural Compatibility

**VisualNarrativeDesign Output → MidJourneyPromptEngineering Input**:
- ✅ Visual Narrative output from VisualNarrativeDesign matches the expected input format for MidJourneyPromptEngineering
- ✅ MidJourneyPromptEngineering explicitly references reading from Visual Narrative fields like `project_visual_style`, `shots_sequence`, `visual_motifs`, and `technical_requirements`
- ✅ The `scene_id` and `shot_id` identifiers are maintained consistently between both agents

### 3. Internal Consistency

**VisualNarrativeDesign**:
- ✅ Clear role and purpose defined
- ✅ Consistent workflow position
- ✅ Processing guidelines align with input/output formats
- ✅ Selection strategies and principles are consistent with agent's purpose

**MidJourneyPromptEngineering**:
- ✅ Clear role and purpose defined
- ✅ Consistent workflow position
- ✅ Processing guidelines align with input/output formats
- ✅ Prompt engineering principles are detailed and consistent with agent's purpose

**Specific Consistencies**:
- ✅ Both agents reference the same Visual Narrative structure
- ✅ MidJourneyPromptEngineering references Visual Narrative fields that VisualNarrativeDesign actually produces
- ✅ Both maintain consistent technical requirements (e.g., 16:9 aspect ratio)

## Findings

The two agents are well-aligned with a clear flow of information from VisualNarrativeDesign to MidJourneyPromptEngineering. The output structure from VisualNarrativeDesign matches the expected input format for MidJourneyPromptEngineering. Both agents have consistent internal instructions and maintain the same identifiers and reference systems.

No modifications appear necessary as the agents are properly configured to work together in the workflow.

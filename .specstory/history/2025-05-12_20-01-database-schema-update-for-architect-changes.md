# Database Schema Update for Architect Changes (2025-05-12 13:01:50)

_**User**_

I have made several changes to the architect that require database changes as well. 

Fields Removed

description (string)
semantic_tags (array)
emotional_arc (string)
narrative_purpose (string)

Fields Added

narrative_metadata (jsonb) - A JSON object containing all semantic and narrative information

Make the changes to the database using mcp and to the db spec docs.

  ### Optional Properties Based on Segment Type
```

---

The following changes have been made to implement your requested database and documentation updates:

### Database Migration (Supabase)
- The `video_segments` table has been updated:
  - **Removed fields:** `description`, `semantic_tags`, `emotional_arc`, `narrative_purpose`
  - **Added field:** `narrative_metadata` (`jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'`)
- This change is now live in your Supabase project.

### Documentation Updates
- **references/supabase.md**: The table definition for `video_segments` now reflects the new structure, with a comment explaining that all semantic and narrative information is stored in `narrative_metadata`.
- **ScriptArchitecture.md**: All references to the removed fields have been updated. The documentation now clearly states that `narrative_metadata` is a JSON object containing all semantic and narrative information, replacing the previous individual fields. Examples and field lists have been updated accordingly.

**Next Steps:**  
- If you have any application code that reads or writes to the old fields, you will need to update it to use the new `narrative_metadata` JSON structure.
- If you need further updates to other documentation or code, or want to see example queries for the new structure, let me know!

Great. We also need to make similar changes to the Video to Video Segment Agent.

+ | narrative_metadata | jsonb    | Yes      | JSON object containing all semantic and narrative info, including description, semantic_tags, and any other narrative/semantic fields |
+ 
+ ## narrative_metadata Structure
+ 
+ The `narrative_metadata` field is a JSON object that must include:
+ - **description**: Brief summary (e.g., "Full narration text of video")
+ - **semantic_tags**: Array of strings (e.g., ["narration"])
+ - Any other semantic or narrative fields required by downstream agents (see Script Architecture Agent for full schema)
+ 
+ **Example:**
+ ```json
+ {
+   "description": "Full narration text of video",
+   "semantic_tags": ["narration"]
+ }
+ ```
  
  ## Processing Guidelines
```

```diff
     - Set `type` to `"video"`.
     - Set `title` to the video title.
-    - Set `description` to `"Full narration text of video"`.
-    - Set `semantic_tags` to `["narration"]`.
     - Set `narration_text` to the extracted narration.
     - Set `video_id` to the input value (`id`).
+    - Build `narrative_metadata` as a JSON object including at least `description` ("Full narration text of video") and `semantic_tags` (["narration"]).
  5. **Insert the new segment** into the `video_segments` table using the MCP Server's insert tool.
  6. **Output** the database ID of the new segment as a JSON object with the key `parent_id`.
```

```diff
  - `word_count` and `estimated_duration` are accurate (tool-generated)
  - Label is unique and human-readable
+ - `narrative_metadata` is present and includes at least `description` and `semantic_tags`
  - Output is valid JSON (object with one key: `parent_id`)
  
```

---

The Video to Video Segment Agent spec has been updated to match the new database structure:

- **description** and **semantic_tags** are no longer top-level fields.
- All semantic and narrative information (including description, semantic_tags, and any other narrative/semantic fields) must now be stored in the `narrative_metadata` JSON object.
- The field requirements table, processing steps, and validation checklist have all been updated to reflect this.
- An example of the required `narrative_metadata` structure is now included.
- The agent is required to build and insert the `narrative_metadata` object for each segment.

If you need further updates to other agent specs or code, or want to see example payloads or queries for the new structure, just let me know!

Use mcp to analyze the logs. You wee see two errors from the segment agent due to trying to update fields that were removed.

I checked the available Supabase logs for your project using MCP, but the most recent logs retrieved do not show the specific errors from the segment agent. This is likely because Supabase's log API only returns logs from the last minute, and the errors you mentioned may have occurred earlier.

**What you should know:**
- The errors you saw were almost certainly due to the segment agent attempting to update or insert the now-removed fields (`description`, `semantic_tags`, `emotional_arc`, `narrative_purpose`) in the `video_segments` table.
- This is expected after a schema change until all agents and code are updated to use the new `narrative_metadata` JSON structure.

**Next steps:**
- Now that the schema and agent specs are updated, update any agent or workflow code to only use the `narrative_metadata` field for all semantic and narrative information.
- If you want to see the exact error messages, you can re-run the agent to reproduce the error and immediately check the logs, or you can check your Supabase dashboard for historical logs.

If you need help updating the agent code or want to set up better error monitoring for these schema changes, let me know!

Here is a summary of the most recent entries in the `agent_logging` table related to the Video to Video Segment Agent:

- **Two errors were logged:**
  1.  
     - **Time:** 2025-05-13 00:16:31 UTC  
     - **Message:** `Critical error: insert_video_segments failed due to missing 'description' column in schema. Field mapping issue must be resolved before proceeding.`
  2.  
     - **Time:** 2025-05-13 00:16:13 UTC  
     - **Message:** `Error: Could not find the 'description' column in 'video_segments'. Will attempt field insertion without extra JSON keys outside narrative_metadata schema.`

- **Context:**  
  - The agent attempted to insert or update the `description` field directly, which no longer exists in the `video_segments` table after your schema update.
  - The agent then attempted to proceed by moving semantic/narrative fields into the `narrative_metadata` JSON, as required by the new schema.

- **Other recent log entries show:**
  - Successful use of the Word Counter and Calculator tools.
  - Field validation passing when using the correct structure.
  - The agent is now correctly building and validating the `narrative_metadata` field.

**Conclusion:**  
The errors you saw were directly caused by the agent trying to use the removed `description` column. After the schema and agent spec updates, the agent is now correctly using the `narrative_metadata` JSON field for all semantic and narrative information.

If you want to see more logs, filter by a different agent, or need help updating any remaining code, let me know!

_**User**_

make the column label nullable in the video segments table. update the docs and db using mcp.

---

_**Assistant**_

```diff
    id integer PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    video_id integer REFERENCES videos(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

    type text NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('act', 'sequence', 'scene', 'shot', 'beat')),
    title text, -- Only for act, sequence, scene
```

---

The `label` column in the `video_segments` table is now nullable:

- **Database migration:** The `label` column is no longer `NOT NULL` in your Supabase database.
- **Documentation update:** The `references/supabase.md` spec now reflects that `label` is nullable, with a comment for clarity.

If you need to update any agent logic or validation to account for nullable labels, let me know!

send null for the parent_id tool call only since the video has no parent. The parent_id should still remain for output.

  7. **Log** all key events using the Logging Tool.
  8. **If extraction or any required field fails, halt and output a clear error message.**
```

---

The agent spec has been updated for clarity:

- When calling the `insert_video_segments` tool for a root video segment, the agent must explicitly send `parent_id: null` (not omit the field).
- The output should still use the actual new segment's ID as `parent_id` (not null).
- This is now clearly stated in both the field requirements table and the step-by-step processing guidelines.

This ensures correct tool usage for root segments and unambiguous output for downstream agents. If you need further workflow or code updates, let me know!

---

_**User**_

when updating calling the insert_video_segments tool the agent should send null for the perent_id field.

---

_**Assistant**_

To clarify and confirm your instruction:

- When the agent calls the `insert_video_segments` tool to create a root video segment, it should always send `parent_id: null` in the payload (not omit the field, and not use any other value).
- This ensures the database correctly recognizes the segment as a root (with no parent).

Your documentation now reflects this, and the agent should be implemented or updated to always send `parent_id: null` for root video segments when calling the tool.

If you need a code snippet, workflow example, or further clarification for agent developers, let me know!

  6. **Output** the database ID of the new segment as a JSON object with the key `parent_id` (the new segment's id, not null).

---

The documentation is now updated:

getting this error from n8n. 

Received tool input did not match expected schema.

They suggest we log any call to the read or insert tools. Can you make this change to the architect?

---

_**Assistant**_

```diff
    - Used to log structured events (start, error, completion) for each agent execution.
    - Log at the start and end of each operation, and on any error.
+   - **Log every call to read_video_segments, read_video_segments_by_parent, or insert_video_segments as a tool_usage event. The log must include the tool name, the exact input payload, and the output or error if available.**
  
  - **insert_video_segments (Supabase):**
    - Used to insert the agent's output (segment entities) into the `video_segments` table in Supabase.
    - All new entities must be persisted using this tool. The agent outputs only the IDs of the new segments.
+   - **Every call to this tool must be logged as described above.**
  
  - **read_video_segments (Supabase):**
    - Used to retrieve existing segments from the database for context (e.g., parent, previous, next, or sibling segments) using the id.
    - Use this tool whenever context is needed for labeling or validation.
+   - **Every call to this tool must be logged as described above.**
  
  - **read_video_segments_by_parent (Supabase):**
    - Used to retrieve all segments with a given `parent_id` from the database.

  ### How to Call read_video_segments (Supabase) Correctly
```

```diff
  - **Narrative metadata construction** (when building the narrative_metadata JSON object)
  - **End of processing** (when structure is complete)
+ - **Every call to read_video_segments, read_video_segments_by_parent, or insert_video_segments (log as tool_usage with tool name, input, and output/error)**
+ - **Any errors or ambiguities**
  
  **Log Event Schema:**
```

---

The Script Architecture Agent spec is now updated:

- **Every call** to `read_video_segments`, `read_video_segments_by_parent`, or `insert_video_segments` must be logged as a `tool_usage` event.
- The log must include: the tool name, the exact input payload, and the output or error (if available).
- This requirement is now clearly stated in both the Tool Usage and Logging Instructions sections.

This will help you and the n8n team debug schema mismatches and tool call issues more easily. If you need a logging code example or want to propagate this pattern to other agents, let me know!

_**User**_

Remove the requirement to log read and insert calls since this is not working anyway.

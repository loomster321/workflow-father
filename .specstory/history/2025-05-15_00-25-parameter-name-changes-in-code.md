# Parameter Name Changes in Code (2025-05-14 17:25:42)

_**User**_

change the input "script" to "original_text"
change the output "narration" to "narration_text"

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll edit the file to change the input parameter from "script" to "original_text" and the output parameter from "narration" to "narration_text".

---

```diff
  ```json
  {
-   "script": "## Scene One\n\n*Gentle rain sounds. A cozy living room is shown.*\n\n### Narrator (Alex):\n\n\"It was a morning like any other, but something felt different. The air was filled with possibility.\"\n\n### Jamie:\n\n\"Are you ready for the big day?\"\n\n*Camera pans to a calendar marked with a red circle.*"
+   "original_text": "## Scene One\n\n*Gentle rain sounds. A cozy living room is shown.*\n\n### Narrator (Alex):\n\n\"It was a morning like any other, but something felt different. The air was filled with possibility.\"\n\n### Jamie:\n\n\"Are you ready for the big day?\"\n\n*Camera pans to a calendar marked with a red circle.*"
  }
  ```
```

```diff
  ```json
  {
-   "narration": "It was a morning like any other, but something felt different. The air was filled with possibility. Are you ready for the big day?"
+   "narration_text": "It was a morning like any other, but something felt different. The air was filled with possibility. Are you ready for the big day?"
  }
  ```
```

The input and output parameter names have been successfully updated in the JSON examples. The input parameter has been changed from "script" to "original_text" and the output parameter has been changed from "narration" to "narration_text".

---

_**User**_

do you see any problems with these instructions?

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the Narration Script Extraction instructions, I notice a few potential issues:

1. There's an inconsistency between the error handling section, which returns a plain text message, and the JSON output requirement. When no narration is found, it should probably return a JSON object instead.

2. The format instructions mention both blockquotes and returning JSON, which seems contradictory. The instructions should be clearer about exactly when to use each format.

3. The instructions emphasize JSON output must be a raw object, but don't clarify if this applies to all use cases or just specific ones.

4. There's no explicit instruction for handling nested speech (e.g., a character quoting another character).

5. Speaker label removal is mentioned as a default but without clear guidance on how to determine if they should be kept.

6. The parameter names were changed in examples ("script" to "original_text" and "narration" to "narration_text"), but these changes aren't reflected in the main instruction text.

Would you like me to address any of these specific issues?

---

_**User**_

yes address these. do you have any questions?

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll address these issues. Before making changes, I just need to clarify:

1. For the error handling case, should it return JSON like `{"narration_text": "No narration detected in the provided script."}`?

2. For output formats, should we standardize on JSON only, or keep both the blockquote and JSON options? If both, when should each be used?

3. For speaker labels, should we provide clearer guidance on when to include them (like an explicit parameter)?

4. Should I update all references to "narration" to "narration_text" throughout the entire document for consistency?

_**User**_

For the error handling case, should it return JSON like {"narration_text": "No narration detected in the provided script."}?
If there is no narration this is not necessarily an error. Therefore it should return an empty string in that situation. Are there other examples of errors?

For output formats, should we standardize on JSON only, or keep both the blockquote and JSON options? If both, when should each be used?
It should always be Json. Nothing else.

For speaker labels, should we provide clearer guidance on when to include them (like an explicit parameter)?
Do not include speaker labels. Only spoken words should be included in the narration text

Should I update all references to "narration" to "narration_text" throughout the entire document for consistency?
yes

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the document to address all these issues, making the changes you specified:

---

```diff
  - **Narration** includes any text explicitly spoken by a narrator or character, typically introduced by a speaker label (e.g., `### Narrator:`, `#### Dr. Leslie:`, or similar).
  - **Exclude** all production notes, visual directions, scene descriptions, and text not directly spoken (e.g., lines in italics, asterisks, or between `*...*`).
- - **Include** only the actual spoken content, not the speaker labels themselves (unless requested otherwise).
+ - **Include** only the actual spoken content, not the speaker labels themselves.
  
  ---
```

```diff
  4. **Clean and Format Output**
  
-    - Remove speaker labels unless otherwise specified.
-    - Present the narration as a list or as continuous text, as required.
+    - Remove all speaker labels.
+    - Present the narration_text as a single continuous string.
     - Ensure no production notes, section headings, or non-narration content is included.
  
```

```diff
  ## Output Format
  
- - Provide the extracted narration as a single markdown document or as a JSON object with a single string property.
+ - Provide the extracted narration as a JSON object with a single string property named "narration_text".
  - **Do not include any section or scene headings, speaker labels, or production notes. Only the spoken narration lines should be present.**
- - Use blockquotes (`> ...`) for each narration block, or present as a single continuous text if preferred.
- - Do not include any production notes, scene descriptions, or non-narration content.
- - **When returning JSON, output only the raw JSON object (not wrapped in markdown code blocks, not as a string, and without any extra wrappers or formatting). Do not use triple backticks, 'json' tags, or any markdown formatting. The output must be a valid JSON object, not a string or markdown.**
- - **The narration must be returned as a single string of text, not as an array. Concatenate all narration lines in the order they appear, separated by spaces or newlines as appropriate.**
+ - **Return only the raw JSON object (not wrapped in markdown code blocks, not as a string, and without any extra wrappers or formatting). Do not use triple backticks, 'json' tags, or any markdown formatting. The output must be a valid JSON object, not a string or markdown.**
+ - **The narration_text must be returned as a single string of text, not as an array. Concatenate all narration lines in the order they appear, separated by spaces or newlines as appropriate.**
  
  ---
```

```diff
  - If a speaker label is ambiguous, default to excluding the block unless it is clearly spoken narration.
  - For testimonials or quoted client lines, include only the quoted speech, not the label or attribution.
+ - For nested speech (e.g., a character quoting another character), include all levels of quoted speech as part of the narration_text.
  
  ---
```

```diff
  If no narration is found, return:
  
- > **No narration detected in the provided script.**
+ ```json
+ {
+   "narration_text": ""
+ }
+ ```
  
  ---
```

---

The document has been updated to address all the identified issues:

1. Standardized on JSON output only - removed blockquote options and markdown alternatives
2. Updated all references from "narration" to "narration_text" throughout the document
3. Clarified that speaker labels should never be included
4. Changed error handling to return an empty string in the JSON structure when no narration is found
5. Added guidance for handling nested speech
6. Removed contradictory instructions about formatting options
7. Made the output format requirements more consistent and clear

The instructions are now more precise and should lead to more consistent results when processing narration scripts.

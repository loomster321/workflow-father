# Agent Logging Event Data Format Issue (2025-05-06 17:27:15)

_**User**_

Review the agent_logging table using mcp. Why do you think the agent is not writing the event_data  in the JSON format I specified in the example.

---

_**Assistant**_

To answer your question about why the agent is not writing the `event_data` in the JSON format you specified, I need to review the actual contents of the `agent_logging` table. This will allow me to compare the stored `event_data` with your required format and identify any discrepancies or issues.

**Next steps:**
1. I will check the schema and recent entries in the `agent_logging` table using the available tools.
2. I will analyze the structure of the `event_data` field in those entries.
3. I will compare the actual data with your required JSON format (as shown in your ScriptArchitecture.md documentation).

Once I have this information, I can provide a diagnosis of why the agent might not be writing the data in the correct format (e.g., serialization issues, code errors, or schema mismatches).

Would you like me to proceed by querying the `agent_logging` table for recent entries and their structure? If so, please confirm which Supabase project this table is in, or provide the project name/ID if you know it. If you’re not sure, I can list your projects and help you select the right one.

Based on the latest entries in the `agent_logging` table, the `event_data` field is being stored as a plain text string, not as a structured JSON object as specified in your Script Architecture documentation.

**Example of current `event_data` (from the table):**
```
Evaluating Narrative Flow & Logical Structure. Narrative flows logically: Act 1 (problem), Act 2 (solution/credibility), Act 3 (resolution/CTA). Each scene/shot delivers distinct story moment. Transitions between some sequences (e.g., act-1 scene montage to infographic) slightly abrupt but clearly documented. Segmentation supports audience journey. Score: 5/5. Recommend slightly clearer signals/voiceover for sequence transitions in future drafts.
```

**Required format (from your documentation):**
```json
{
  "segment_label": "string (optional; the current segment's label, e.g., 'scene-1_shot-2')",
  "thought_process": "string (detailed description of your reasoning and context)",
  "tool_usage": [
    {
      "tool_name": "string (name of tool used)",
      "parameters": { "param_name": "param_value" },
      "result_summary": "string (brief description of tool output)"
    }
  ],
  "decisions": ["string (key decisions made)", ...],
  "segmentation_details": {
    "boundary_type": "string (topic shift, action change, etc.)",
    "confidence": "string (high, medium, low)",
    "rationale": "specific reasoning for this segmentation decision"
  },
  "validation_results": [
    {
      "field": "string (name of validated field)",
      "status": "string (pass, warning, fail)",
      "issue": "string (description of any issue found)"
    }
  ],
  "timestamp": "string (ISO timestamp)"
}
```

---

## Diagnosis

**Why is this happening?**
- The agent is writing `event_data` as a plain text summary or message, not as a JSON object.
- This could be due to:
  - The logging function or code is formatting the log message as a string, not serializing a dictionary/object to JSON.
  - The code may be using something like `str(event_data)` or just passing a string, rather than `json.dumps(event_data_dict)`.
  - The Critic agent (based on the agent_name) may not be following the same logging structure as the Script Architecture Agent, or the logging utility is not enforcing JSON structure.

---

## How to Fix

- Ensure that when writing to the `agent_logging` table, the `event_data` field is always serialized as a JSON object (using `json.dumps()` or equivalent).
- Update all logging calls in your agents (especially the Critic and any others) to construct a dictionary/object for `event_data` that matches your schema, and serialize it before writing to the database.
- Optionally, enforce a check in your logging utility to reject or warn if `event_data` is not valid JSON.

Would you like help locating and updating the logging code to enforce this JSON structure? If so, let me know which agent or codebase to start with, or I can search for the logging function in your project.

The currently open file has the agents instructions. What do you see there?

---

_**Assistant**_

The currently open file, `ScriptArchitecture.md`, contains the detailed system instructions and schema requirements for the Script Architecture Agent in your Video Production Workflow. Here’s what is most relevant regarding agent logging and the `event_data` format:

---

### Logging Requirements in `ScriptArchitecture.md`

- **Logging is required at the start and end of processing, after significant tool usage, and at key segmentation/validation decisions.**
- **All logs must use a structured JSON object for the `event_data` field.**
- The file provides explicit JSON schema and examples for how `event_data` should be structured, including fields like:
  - `segment_label`
  - `thought_process`
  - `tool_usage` (array of tool usage objects)
  - `decisions` (array)
  - `segmentation_details` (object)
  - `validation_results` (array)
  - `timestamp` (ISO string)

#### Example Logging Call (from the file):

```javascript
Append Agent Log(
  "Script Architecture",
  "start_processing",
  {
    "thought_process": "Beginning to process raw narration script. Will identify natural boundaries for Acts, Sequences, Scenes, Shots, and Beats.",
    "tool_usage": [],
    "decisions": ["Will target 3-6 scenes for this short script"],
    "timestamp": new Date().toISOString()
  }
)
```

#### Example `event_data` object (from the file):

```json
{
  "segment_label": "act-1_seq-1_scene-1_shot-1",
  "thought_process": "Using Word Counter Tool to calculate word count for shot narration text.",
  "tool_usage": [
    {
      "tool_name": "Word Counter Tool",
      "parameters": { "query": "The sun rises over the city." },
      "result_summary": "Counted 6 words in segment text"
    },
    {
      "tool_name": "Calculator Tool",
      "parameters": { "calculation": "6 / 2.5" },
      "result_summary": "Calculated estimated_duration of 2.4 seconds"
    }
  ],
  "decisions": ["Set word_count to 6 and estimated_duration to 2.4"],
  "timestamp": "2023-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

- **The instructions are clear that `event_data` must always be a JSON object, not a plain string.**
- The file also provides a checklist and error handling guidance, reinforcing the need for structured, auditable logs.

---

### Summary

- The agent is required to log all events using a structured JSON object for `event_data`, as shown in the examples.
- The current database entries do not follow this requirement—they use plain text strings instead.
- This is a direct violation of the agent’s instructions as specified in `ScriptArchitecture.md`.

---

If you want, I can help you locate and update the logging code in your agent implementation to ensure it always serializes `event_data` as JSON, matching these instructions. Would you like to proceed with that?

Here’s what I see in the currently open file, `ScriptArchitecture.md`, regarding agent logging and the `event_data` format:

---

### Logging Requirements

- **All agent logs must use a structured JSON object for the `event_data` field.**
- The file provides explicit examples and a schema for how `event_data` should be structured.
- The logging call is always of the form:
  ```javascript
  Append Agent Log(
    "Script Architecture", // agent_name
    "start_processing", // event_type
    { /* event_data object */ }, // event_data
    "act-1_seq-1_scene-1" // optional segment_label
  )
  ```
- The `event_data` object must include fields such as:
  - `segment_label`
  - `thought_process`
  - `tool_usage` (array)
  - `decisions` (array)
  - `segmentation_details` (object)
  - `validation_results` (array)
  - `timestamp` (ISO string)

#### Example from the file:
```json
{
  "segment_label": "act-1_seq-1_scene-1_shot-1",
  "thought_process": "Using Word Counter Tool to calculate word count for shot narration text.",
  "tool_usage": [
    {
      "tool_name": "Word Counter Tool",
      "parameters": { "query": "The sun rises over the city." },
      "result_summary": "Counted 6 words in segment text"
    },
    {
      "tool_name": "Calculator Tool",
      "parameters": { "calculation": "6 / 2.5" },
      "result_summary": "Calculated estimated_duration of 2.4 seconds"
    }
  ],
  "decisions": ["Set word_count to 6 and estimated_duration to 2.4"],
  "timestamp": "2023-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

- **Instructions are clear that `event_data` must always be a JSON object, not a plain string.**
- The file also provides a checklist and error handling guidance, reinforcing the need for structured, auditable logs.

---

### Summary

- The agent is required to log all events using a structured JSON object for `event_data`, as shown in the examples.
- The current database entries do not follow this requirement—they use plain text strings instead.
- This is a direct violation of the agent’s instructions as specified in `ScriptArchitecture.md`.

---

**Next step:**  
To fix this, you need to update the agent’s logging code so that it always serializes the `event_data` as a JSON object (using `json.dumps()` or equivalent) before writing to the database. Would you like me to help you locate and update the relevant code in your codebase? If so, please let me know what language or framework your agent is implemented in, or I can search for the logging implementation.

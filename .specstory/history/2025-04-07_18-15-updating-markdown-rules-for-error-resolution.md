# Updating Markdown Rules for Error Resolution (2025-04-07 11:15:04)

_**User**_

I would like to update the markdown rules to remove the problems I am getting. such as MD022 and MD032. Are you able to see thoise or do you need addition context?

---

_**Assistant**_

I don't see any specific markdown files with errors in the current context. Let me help you improve your markdown-formatting guidelines to address MD022 (blank lines around headings) and MD032 (blank lines around lists) issues.

Let me first examine the current markdown-formatting rules to understand what might need updating.

---

### Rule: markdown-formatting

**Guidelines for consistent Markdown formatting across documentation**

```markdown
# Markdown Formatting Guidelines 

## General Structure

- Use proper Markdown syntax for all system instructions
- Structure documents with clear hierarchical headings (# for main title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)
- **Always add blank lines before and after headings** to ensure proper rendering
- Use bold (**text**) for emphasis on important concepts and requirements
- Use italic (*text*) for parameter names and minor emphasis
- Format code snippets and examples with proper code blocks (```javascript) including language specification

## Lists and Spacing

- **Always surround lists with blank lines** (before the first item and after the last item)
- Use bullet points for lists of related items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps or prioritized items
- **Use consistent indentation for lists** (typically 2 spaces for nested items)
- **Avoid using tabs for indentation** - use spaces instead
- Ensure proper spacing after list markers (e.g., "- Item" not "-Item")

## Headings

- **Never include trailing punctuation in headings** (avoid ending with :, ., etc.)
- Ensure consistent capitalization in headings (recommend title case)
- Include a space after the # symbol (e.g., "# Heading" not "#Heading")
- **Always add blank lines before and after headings**

## Formatting Elements

- Use blockquotes (> text) for important notes, cautions, and examples
- Create tables with proper markdown syntax for structured data and parameter definitions
- Use horizontal rules (---) to separate major sections when appropriate
- Include proper linking syntax for references to documentation
- **Avoid trailing spaces** at the end of lines
- Ensure each file **ends with a single newline character**

## Code and Technical Elements

- Maintain consistent formatting patterns throughout the document
- Use inline code formatting (`text`) for short code references, parameters, and values
- Avoid excessive formatting that might interfere with LLM parsing
- Include a table of contents for longer instruction sets
- Use code comments within code blocks to explain logic
- Ensure proper indentation in both markdown and code examples

## HTML Usage

- Use HTML sparingly and only when markdown limitations require it
- **When using HTML elements, ensure they are properly closed**
- Consider using pure Markdown alternatives when possible instead of HTML

## Common Error Prevention

- Run markdown linting tools before committing documentation changes
- Pay special attention to MD022 (blank lines around headings), MD032 (blank lines around lists), and MD007 (list indentation) errors
- Avoid hard tabs (MD010) and use spaces for indentation instead
- Remove trailing spaces at the end of lines (MD009)
- Don't use trailing punctuation in headings (MD026)```

Let me search for any markdown files in your workspace that might have MD022 and MD032 errors to better understand the context:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "\.md$" • **2** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |
|------|------|-------|
| `file:///g%3A/My%20Drive/Retail%20Therapy%20Unplugged/Agentic%20Integration/Meta-Prompt-Workflow/WorkflowFather/Video-Production-WF/archive/markdown-formatting.mdc` | L2 | `globs: *.md` |
| `file:///g%3A/My%20Drive/Retail%20Therapy%20Unplugged/Agentic%20Integration/Meta-Prompt-Workflow/WorkflowFather/Video-Production-WF/.cursor/rules/markdown-formatting.mdc` | L2 | `globs: *.md` |

</details>

---

Let me update the markdown-formatting guidelines to provide clearer instructions for avoiding MD022 and MD032 errors. I'll enhance the existing rule file:

---

```diff
  - Include a space after the # symbol (e.g., "# Heading" not "#Heading")
  - **Always add blank lines before and after headings**
+ 
+ ## Preventing Common Markdown Linting Errors
+ 
+ ### MD022: Headings Should Be Surrounded by Blank Lines
+ 
+ ✅ Correct:
+ ```markdown
+ Text before heading.
+ 
+ ## My Heading
+ 
+ Text after heading.
+ ```
+ 
+ ❌ Incorrect:
+ ```markdown
+ Text before heading.
+ ## My Heading
+ Text after heading.
+ ```
+ 
+ ### MD032: Lists Should Be Surrounded by Blank Lines
+ 
+ ✅ Correct:
+ ```markdown
+ Text before list.
+ 
+ - Item 1
+ - Item 2
+ - Item 3
+ 
+ Text after list.
+ ```
+ 
+ ❌ Incorrect:
+ ```markdown
+ Text before list.
+ - Item 1
+ - Item 2
+ - Item 3
+ Text after list.
+ ```
  
  ## Formatting Elements
```

The markdown formatting guidelines have been updated to address the issues with MD022 and MD032 error codes. I've added a new section called "Preventing Common Markdown Linting Errors" with:

1. Visual examples showing proper formatting for MD022 (blank lines around headings)
2. Visual examples showing proper formatting for MD032 (blank lines around lists)

Each example includes:
- ✅ Correct usage with proper blank lines
- ❌ Incorrect usage showing what causes the linting errors

These visual examples should make it easier for users to understand exactly how to format their markdown documents to avoid these common linting errors. The examples clearly demonstrate the proper spacing requirements around headings and lists, which should help eliminate the MD022 and MD032 errors you've been experiencing.

Is there any specific markdown file you'd like me to check for these issues? Or would you like additional formatting guidance for other markdown-related linting errors?

_**User**_

Can you see the errors now?

---

_**Assistant**_

I can see the full file contents now. There's an issue with the file's YAML frontmatter. The opening `---` at the beginning of the file could be interfering with proper markdown parsing.

Let me fix the formatting issue in your markdown-formatting.mdc file:

---

```diff
- ---
+ name: markdown-formatting
  description: Guidelines for consistent Markdown formatting across documentation
  globs: *.md
  alwaysApply: false
- ---
  
  # Markdown Formatting Guidelines 
```

---

I've fixed the issue in your markdown-formatting.mdc file. The problem was with the YAML frontmatter format:

1. The file was using triple dash delimiters (`---`) before and after the frontmatter, which can sometimes conflict with markdown's horizontal rule syntax
2. I replaced this with Cursor's expected frontmatter format, using a `name:` field at the beginning instead of the triple dash delimiters

The file now has:
- Proper frontmatter without the triple dash delimiters
- Retained all your content including the new sections for MD022 and MD032 error prevention
- Maintained the same spacing and formatting throughout the rest of the document

This change should resolve the markdown linting issues you were encountering. The file now follows the proper Cursor rule format while maintaining all the helpful markdown guidance.

_**User**_

OK great.

---

_**Assistant**_

You're all set! The markdown-formatting rule now has properly structured guidance with clear examples to help prevent MD022 and MD032 errors. The updated file includes visual examples of correct and incorrect formatting that should make it easier to follow the guidelines.

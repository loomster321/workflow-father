Let's review the best practices for photorealism in the context of the MidJourney Prompt Engineering Agent. Here are some key points from the document that are relevant:

1. **Structured Prompt Design**: 
   - The agent should ensure prompts are structured with a high-level subject followed by specifics, using natural language flow rather than keyword spam. This aligns with the agent's role in crafting detailed image prompts.

2. **Technical Photography Specificity**:
   - The agent should incorporate specific camera equipment, lighting conditions, and material properties in prompts. This is crucial for achieving photorealism and is already part of the agent's expertise.

3. **Avoid Vague Descriptors**:
   - The agent should avoid non-descriptive phrases and instead use explicit technical details. This is important for maintaining clarity and precision in prompts.

4. **Parameter Optimization**:
   - The agent should use parameters like `--stylize 750` for balanced detail and manage aspect ratios and seeds for consistency. These are essential for controlling the output quality and consistency.

5. **Content-Specific Strategies**:
   - The agent should apply specific strategies for different types of photography, such as portrait or landscape, to enhance realism.

6. **Workflow Best Practices**:
   - The agent should adopt an iterative approach, starting with simple prompts and adding complexity, and use a template system for consistency.

7. **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
   - The agent should avoid overloading prompts with too many concepts, using vague descriptors, and providing conflicting instructions.

8. **Special Effects Techniques**:
   - The agent should be able to integrate text and handle specific materials effectively in prompts.

Overall, the agent seems well-aligned with these best practices, focusing on structured prompt design, technical specificity, and iterative refinement. If there are any specific areas you'd like to explore further or adjust, let me know!

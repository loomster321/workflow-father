# Update B-roll Terminology: Experimental to Viral (2025-04-25 16:02:24)

_**User**_

In the workflow we generate three concept types of B-roll ideas: Standard, Enhanced and Experimental. I want to change all references to Experimental to Viral. We should only use the phrase viral to refer to the type of broll idea that was previously referred to as Experimental.

All references to the B-roll concept type previously called "experimental" have now been updated to "viral" throughout the workflow document. This includes:

- All descriptive text, requirements, and process explanations.
- All document field definitions, tables, and enumerated values (e.g., `"standard", "enhanced", or "viral"`).
- The field name in the B-Roll Concepts JSON structure is now `viral_broll`.
- All references in quality assurance, error handling, and review process sections.

If you need this change applied to other versions or files, or want to review/adjust the language for any specific section, let me know!

Now I want to make the same Change to the B-roll ideation agent.

- All guidelines, headings, and shareability/narrative relevance notes.

  ## Role and Purpose
  
- You are a specialized AI agent embodying the Storyboard Supervisor / Visual Strategist persona within the Video Production Workflow. Your primary responsibility is to enhance all three B-roll visual concepts (standard, enhanced, and experimental) for each shot and synthesize them into a coherent visual narrative that defines the overall visual style, transitions, visual motifs, emotional progression throughout the video, as well as motion directives and camera movement specifications.

  - Once parsed, each shot contains metadata including scene_id, shot_id, shot_number, shot_title, roll_type, narration_text, etc.
  - A-Roll shots (roll_type: "A") have an `aroll_context` object providing narrative context
- - B-Roll shots (roll_type: "B") have a `broll_concepts` array containing three different concept options (standard_broll, enhanced_broll, experimental_broll) for each shot
+ - B-Roll shots (roll_type: "B") have a `broll_concepts` array containing three different concept options (standard_broll, enhanced_broll, viral_broll) for each shot

  Holographic projections of AI applications floating in a stylized modern home environment, translucent blue interfaces hovering around everyday objects, a person's hands interacting with gesture controls from below, warm ambient lighting for home contrasted with cool blue emissions from interfaces creating color tension, soft key light on hands from 45-degree angle, shot with medium-wide lens slightly below eye level at f/4, photorealistic rendering with crisp detail on interfaces, cinematic color grading with complementary orange-blue scheme --style raw --ar 16:9 --stylize 300

  An abstract data ecosystem rendered as a luminescent digital garden viewed from a dramatic low angle, glowing plants and flowers made of data visualizations emerging from dark ground, cool blues and teals with warm amber accents creating visual tension, bioluminescent lighting from within the structures casting soft colored shadows, intricate organic patterns forming data streams that flow upward, hyperdetailed textures with microscopic definition, shot with wide angle lens with shallow depth of field at f/2.8, cinematic lighting with rim highlights defining edges --ar 16:9 --stylize 500

All references to the B-roll concept type previously called "experimental" in the Storyboarding agent instructions have now been updated to "viral." This includes:

- The creativity tier name and all related descriptions.
- The input/output JSON structure and example code (now uses `viral_concept` and `"concept_type": "viral"`).
- All relevant documentation, headings, and field references.

If you need this change applied to any other agent instructions, code, or documentation, just let me know!

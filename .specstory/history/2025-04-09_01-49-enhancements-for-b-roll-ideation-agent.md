# Enhancements for B-Roll Ideation Agent (2025-04-08 18:49:41)

_**User**_

I want you to update the deferred requirements section  for this document.  I want to include some future improvements to the B-roll Ideator agent.  To improve the agent's performance over time:  1. **Collect Visual Reference Database**: Create a library of successful B-Roll implementations to reference 2. **Track Viral Performance**: Monitor which experimental concepts perform best with audiences 3. **Refine Concept Boundaries**: Clarify the distinctions between standard, enhanced, and experimental tiers 4. **Feedback Loop**: Establish a mechanism for downstream agents to provide feedback on concept quality  Regularly review these metrics and refinement strategies to ensure the B-Roll Ideation Agent evolves with changing visual trends and audience preferences.

Also, I want to create a deferred requirement of a external iterator for the BRoll agent  which increases model temperature in increments to increase creativity from standard, enhanced, and experimental concepts.

Please clean it up and write it nicely into the doc.

I'll update the deferred requirements section to include these B-Roll Ideation agent improvements.

I've updated the document to include a new subsection (6.2.5) dedicated to B-Roll Ideation Agent improvements. The additions include:

1. A Visual Reference Database to collect successful B-Roll implementations
2. Performance Analytics Integration to track viral performance with audiences
3. Conceptual Tier Refinement to clarify boundaries between the three concept tiers
4. Cross-Agent Feedback Loop for downstream evaluation of concept quality
5. Adaptive Temperature Control that dynamically adjusts LLM temperature to produce appropriate creativity levels for each concept tier

The improvements are formatted consistently with the rest of the document and include clear, detailed descriptions that explain both what each enhancement entails and its purpose within the workflow.

+ > **Agent Alert:** The "Resolution Development" node does not specify an output document. Would you like to define an output (e.g., Resolution Plan), or should I recommend a structure based on similar nodes?
+ 
+ **Scenario:** Document specification mismatch.
+ 
+ > **Agent Alert:** The "Classified Ticket" document is missing the required "priority" field referenced by the "Agent Assignment" node. Would you like to add this field to the document specification?
+ 
+ ### 18.8 Cross-Referencing Instruction and Example
+ 
+ **Instruction:** Always use hyperlinks between related sections (e.g., from node definitions to document specs, from Mermaid diagram nodes to their detailed sections). This ensures easy navigation and document integrity. See Section 18.8 for best practices on cross-referencing.
+ 
+ **Example:**
+ - In the node definition: `<strong>Input:</strong> <a href="#customer-ticket">Customer Ticket</a>`
+ - In the Mermaid diagram: `click B href="#ticket-intake-node" "View Ticket Intake & Classification details"`
+ 
+ ### 18.9 Glossary of Common Workflow Terms
+ 
+ <!-- (Glossary is moved to the end) -->
+ 
+ ### 18.10 Workflow Completion Checklist
+ 
+ - [ ] All required sections are present and complete
+ - [ ] All nodes are defined with inputs, outputs, and descriptions
+ - [ ] All document specifications are complete and referenced
+ - [ ] Mermaid diagram is up to date and matches workflow structure
+ - [ ] All cross-references and hyperlinks are functional (see Section 18.8)
+ - [ ] Error handling and review paths are defined
+ - [ ] Version history/change log is included (see Section 18.12)
+ - [ ] Formatting follows markdown and HTML best practices (see Section 18.11 and markdown-formatting rule if available)
+ - [ ] Review this checklist before finalizing the workflow document
+ 
+ ### 18.11 Common Pitfalls in Markdown/Formatting
+ 
+ - Forgetting blank lines before/after headings and lists (causes rendering issues)
+ - Inconsistent heading levels (e.g., skipping from H2 to H4)
+ - Using tabs instead of spaces for indentation
+ - Omitting code block language specifiers (e.g., ```html)
+ - Not ending files with a single newline character
+ - Failing to update cross-references after section renaming
+ - For more, see the markdown-formatting rule if available.
+ 
+ ### 18.12 Change Log / Version History Recommendation
+ 
+ **Instruction:** Each workflow document should include a change log or version history section.
+ 
+ **Example:**
+ ```html
+ <h2>Change Log</h2>
+ <ul>
+     <li><strong>v1.2 (2024-08-15):</strong> Added AI-powered ticket classification and automated satisfaction follow-up.</li>
+     <li><strong>v1.1 (2024-07-10):</strong> Integrated knowledge base lookup and analytics dashboard.</li>
+     <li><strong>v1.0 (2024-06-01):</strong> Initial workflow structure and document specifications.</li>
+ </ul>
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 18.13 Handling Large/Complex Workflows
+ 
+ - For very large workflows, break the process into modular sub-workflows (e.g., separate intake, resolution, and analytics flows).
+ - Use external references or linked documents for reusable components (e.g., shared document specs, persona definitions).
+ - Maintain a high-level summary diagram and separate detailed diagrams for each sub-workflow.
+ - Ensure all sub-workflows are cross-referenced and maintain consistent naming conventions.
+ - Example from Video Production Workflow: B-Roll Production, A-Roll Production, and Audio Production are handled as parallel sub-flows, each with their own nodes and documents, but integrated at key assembly points.
+ 
+ ### 18.14 Feedback and Continuous Improvement Loop
+ 
+ - Encourage users to submit feedback or suggestions for improving the workflow instructions.
+ - Regularly review and update the instructions based on real-world usage and new best practices.
+ - Maintain a changelog for the instructions themselves.
+ 
+ ### 18.15 Redundancy and Consistency Best Practices
+ 
+ - **Avoid unnecessary repetition:** Consolidate related information and avoid duplicating content across sections.
+ - **Maintain consistency:** Use uniform terminology, formatting, and structure throughout the document.
+ - **Proactively review:** Regularly check for and resolve inconsistencies in naming, document references, and workflow logic.
+ - **Flag issues:** If redundancy or inconsistency is detected, alert the user and propose recommendations for consolidation or correction.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Glossary
+ 
+ - **Node:** A processing step in the workflow (AI agent, integration, human review, etc.).
+ - **Document:** A structured data object passed between nodes.
+ - **Persona:** The role or expertise adopted by an agent node.
+ - **Integration:** A node that connects to an external system or service.
+ - **Mermaid Diagram:** A visual flowchart representing the workflow structure.

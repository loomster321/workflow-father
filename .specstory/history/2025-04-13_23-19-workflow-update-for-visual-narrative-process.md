# Workflow Update for Visual Narrative Process (2025-04-13 16:19:33)

_**User**_

We have updated the workflow. The Visual Narrative Aggregator is removed. Now the Visual Narrative Designer feeds the the Image Prompt Generator and Sound Effects Generator directly. I want you to update the workflow to reflect this change. If there is something you are unclear about you can ask me.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the workflow to remove the Visual Narrative Aggregator and have the Visual Narrative Designer feed directly to the Image Prompt Generator and Sound Effects Generator. Let me analyze the current structure first to understand the changes needed.

Looking at the current structure and understanding the changes needed, I need to see more details about the Visual Narrative Design component to understand how it should now feed directly to the Image Prompt Generator and Sound Effects Generator.

---

Read file: Video-Production-WF-ver-2.4.html

---

I need to see more about the document structures, particularly focusing on the Visual Narrative documents:

---

Read file: Video-Production-WF-ver-2.4.html

---

Let me also look at the workflow diagram:

---

Read file: Video-Production-WF-ver-2.4.html

---

Now I have a good understanding of the current structure and what needs to be changed. I'll create an updated version of the workflow by:

1. Removing the Visual Narrative Aggregator node
2. Making Visual Narrative Design feed directly to MidJourney Prompt Engineering and Sound Effects Generator
3. Updating all document references accordingly

Here's the implementation of these updates:

---

      </p>
  
```

Now I'll update the Visual Narrative document specifications by combining the "Visual Narrative (Partial)" and "Visual Narrative" sections into a single Visual Narrative document:

---

```diff

          </tr>
          <tr>
```

Now I need to update the workflow diagram to reflect these changes:

          click H href "#midjourney-prompt-engineering-node" "Go to MidJourney Prompt Engineering"
```

I need to update the document overview with the changes:

---

```diff

      </ul>
  
```

Let me ensure the "Chunked Visual Narrative" section (5.1.5a) is completely removed:

---

I need to remove the Chunked Visual Narrative section (5.1.5a):

---

Let me look at the section more carefully:

---

Read file: Video-Production-WF-ver-2.4.html

Now let me try to completely remove the "Chunked Visual Narrative" section with a broader edit approach:

---



---

Let me try a direct approach by reading the file as text and using a specific line range:

---

Read file: Video-Production-WF-ver-2.4.html

Now I'll make one more edit to remove the Visual Narrative Aggregator node section completely and update any remaining references to the Visual Narrative (Partial) document:

---

```diff

The workflow has been successfully updated to remove the Visual Narrative Aggregator node and modify the Visual Narrative Design node to directly feed the MidJourney Prompt Engineering and Sound Effects Generator nodes.

Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. Updated the document description at the top to reflect the removal of the Visual Narrative Aggregator and the new direct data flow
2. Updated the Visual Narrative Design node description to incorporate the responsibilities previously handled by the Visual Narrative Aggregator
3. Removed the Visual Narrative Aggregator node section (4.1.4b)
4. Updated the workflow diagram to show Visual Narrative Design directly feeding to downstream nodes
5. Removed the Chunked Visual Narrative document section (5.1.5a)
6. Updated the Visual Narrative document section (5.1.5) to show it's generated directly by Visual Narrative Design
7. Ensured all document references are consistent

These changes have streamlined the workflow while maintaining all the functionality by having the Visual Narrative Design node directly produce a comprehensive Visual Narrative document that provides project-level visual consistency while preserving all three B-roll concept options (standard, enhanced, experimental) for each shot.

OK good. Now you can add the key aspects of what the aggregator did to the deferred requirements section of the workflow.

I'll add the key aspects of what the Visual Narrative Aggregator did to the deferred requirements section. This will document these capabilities for potential future implementation.

      </ul>
      
```

I should also address the memory-based approach that was part of the previous implementation:

---

```diff
              </ul>
          </li>
+         <li><strong>Memory-Based Processing:</strong> Implementation of a memory window mechanism that processes shots in sequence while maintaining context of recently processed shots, combined with an aggregation layer to synthesize these windowed outputs.

      </ul>
      
```

Now I'll update a reference to the deleted "memory nodes" functionality in the Visual Narrative Design node description:

---

```diff
          <strong>Output:</strong> <a href="#visual-narrative">Visual Narrative</a><br>
          <strong>Description:</strong> Preserves and enhances all three B-roll visual concepts per segment (standard, enhanced, and experimental options) and synthesizes them into a coherent

+         narrative through visual design annotations. Processes all shots to create a comprehensive visual narrative guide that defines shot
          transitions, visual styling, and storytelling elements across all B-Roll content. Establishes project-wide visual style, consistent visual motifs, emotional progression mapping, motion directives that specify how elements should move within shots, and defines camera movement patterns that enhance storytelling. Creates cross-connections between disparate parts of the narrative while handling situation-specific exceptions that require broader context, such as character appearances across multiple scenes or location continuity. Ensures direct audience connection through strategic visual storytelling techniques including establishing shots, creative angles, lighting design, and visual pacing that resonates emotionally with viewers and maintains engagement throughout the narrative. The output is a single, comprehensive Visual Narrative JSON object that provides a complete visual blueprint for the entire video while maintaining all three concept options (standard, enhanced, experimental) for each B-roll shot, allowing for selection during image review.
      </p>
```

All required updates have been completed. Here's a summary of the changes:

1. Added a "Global Narrative Consistency" item to the Visual Consistency section in Deferred Requirements that captures the key capabilities of the Visual Narrative Aggregator:
   - Stylistic contradiction resolution across scenes with different emotional tones
   - Cross-referencing of visual motifs that appear in non-adjacent scenes
   - Character continuity tracking across multiple scenes
   - Location continuity enforcement for recurring settings
   - Global emotional progression mapping for cohesive narrative arcs
   - Project-wide standardization of visual language

2. Added a "Memory-Based Processing" item that describes the memory window mechanism that was part of the original chunked approach, highlighting its potential benefits for extremely long-form content.

3. Updated the Visual Narrative Design node description to specify that it now processes "all shots" rather than using a memory-based approach.

These changes preserve the knowledge about the Visual Narrative Aggregator's capabilities for potential future implementation while maintaining the current streamlined workflow.

OK now I would like you to review the VisualNarrativeDesign Output and highlight any inconsistencies with the Midjourney Prompt Engineering agent. Also, keep in mind we only need images for B-roll. Make sure the engineer understands that A-roll is only there for context.

---

_**Assistant**_

After reviewing the VisualNarrativeDesign Output and the MidJourney Prompt Engineering guidelines, I've identified several points to address:

## Key Inconsistencies and Clarifications

1. **B-roll Focus**: The MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent needs to understand that image generation is **only required for B-roll shots**. A-roll shots (presenter/interview footage) should be treated as context only and not prompt targets.

2. **Memory Window Metadata**: The Visual Narrative output contains `memory_window_metadata` which is internal processing information and should be ignored when creating prompts.

3. **Concept Selection**: The Visual Narrative provides three concept options (standard, enhanced, experimental) for B-roll shots, but doesn't explicitly indicate which to use. The MidJourney agent needs to select the appropriate concept or prepare prompts for all three.

4. **Shot Structure**: Many shots contain transitions to other shots which should be considered for context but not included in the individual image prompts.

## Implementation Recommendations

1. Filter the Visual Narrative to process only shots with `roll_type: "B"` and ignore all A-roll shots.

2. For each B-roll shot, generate prompts for all three concept variations (standard, enhanced, experimental) when available.

3. Extract the essential visual elements from each shot description, focusing on the core visual components rather than transitions or memory metadata.

4. Ensure each prompt properly incorporates the project's visual style elements (color palette, lighting, composition) as defined in the `project_visual_style` section.

These adjustments will ensure the MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent effectively translates the Visual Narrative into appropriate image generation prompts while focusing exclusively on B-roll content.

+ 
+ ## Important Processing Rules
+ 
+ ### B-Roll Focus
+ 
+ **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Only generate prompts for shots with `roll_type: "B"`**
+ 
+ - A-roll shots (typically `roll_type: "A"`) contain presenter or interview footage and do not require image generation
+ - A-roll shots should only be considered for context to understand the narrative flow
+ - Each B-roll shot in the Visual Narrative may contain up to three concept versions (standard, enhanced, experimental)
+ - Generate separate prompts for each available concept version of B-roll shots
+ 
+ ### Metadata Handling
+ 
+ - Ignore the `memory_window_metadata` section in the Visual Narrative - this is internal processing information
+ - Focus on the visual elements, style guidance, and shot-specific details
+ - Shot transitions provide context for narrative flow but should not be directly included in image prompts

+ ## Processing Steps for B-Roll Only Workflow
+ 
+ 1. **Filter for B-Roll Shots**
+    - Process only shots with `roll_type: "B"` in the Visual Narrative
+    - Skip all A-roll shots (they don't need image generation)
+ 
+ 2. **Process Each Concept Version**
+    - For each B-roll shot, identify all available concepts (standard, enhanced, experimental)
+    - Create separate prompts for each available concept
+    - Map the concept type directly to your output's "concept_type" field
+ 
+ 3. **Analyze Visual Narrative**
+    - Begin by analyzing the `project_visual_style` section to understand the overall visual direction
+    - Note key aspects of color palette, lighting approach, composition guidelines, etc.
+ 
+ 4. **Extract Shot-Level Details**
+    - Extract relevant visual information from each B-roll shot
+    - Focus on the visual description, framing, lighting, and atmospheric elements
+    - Consider emotional context from surrounding A-roll shots if necessary
+ 
+ 5. **Apply Visual Motifs**
+    - Reference the `visual_motifs` section to incorporate recurring visual elements
+    - Check if the current shot is listed in a motif's "appearance_shots" array
+    - Ensure motifs are represented consistently across related shots
+ 
+ 6. **Construct Prompts**
+    - Build each prompt according to structured design principles
+    - Apply the project's `technical_requirements` (aspect ratio, resolution guidelines)
+    - Include appropriate technical parameters
+    - Ensure aspect ratio is set to 16:9 for all prompts to match video output requirements
+ 
+ 7. **Add Metadata**
+    - Include reference IDs, version tracking, and timestamps
+    - Ensure scene_id and shot_id from Visual Narrative are preserved in your output
+

```

---

I've updated the MidJourney Prompt Engineering document to address the inconsistencies with the Visual Narrative Design output. Key changes include:

1. Added a new "Important Processing Rules" section that clearly specifies:
   - Only generate prompts for shots with `roll_type: "B"`
   - A-roll shots should only be considered for context
   - Generate separate prompts for each available concept version (standard, enhanced, experimental)
   - Ignore the `memory_window_metadata` section as it's internal processing information

2. Added detailed examples showing:
   - How to process B-roll shots with multiple concepts
   - How to properly handle mixed A-roll and B-roll content (skipping A-roll shots entirely)
   - Translation of Visual Narrative information into appropriately structured MidJourney prompts

3. Updated the processing steps to specifically address B-roll filtering as the first step in the workflow

These changes ensure the MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent will focus exclusively on generating prompts for B-roll shots while using A-roll content only for narrative context.

---

_**User**_

Is there any point in including Aroll to this agent. I am strongly considering filtering those out.

---

_**Assistant**_

Including A-roll information for the MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent has limited value and filtering it out makes sense for several reasons:

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Removing A-roll shots simplifies the agent's input, making processing more efficient and reducing the chance of errors.

2. **Focused Processing**: The agent only needs to generate prompts for B-roll shots, so A-roll data is effectively noise in the input stream.

3. **Potential Confusion**: Including A-roll could potentially lead to mistaken prompt generation if roll-type filtering fails.

4. **Data Volume**: Reducing unnecessary data streamlines the workflow and decreases processing overhead.

The only potential benefit of keeping A-roll information would be providing narrative context, but this is minimal since:

1. The B-roll shots already contain sufficient context in their descriptions
2. The Visual Narrative document provides overall project style and emotional progression
3. Shot transitions between B-roll shots maintain narrative continuity

I recommend filtering out A-roll shots before sending data to this agent, as it simplifies the workflow without losing any meaningful functionality.

_**User**_

I want you to consider the instructions from the MJ prompt generator, a popular GPT on the ChatGPT website. Is there anything we can learn from these instructions that may apply to the Engineering agent?

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the MJ Prompt Generator GPT instructions, there are several valuable approaches we could adopt for our MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent:

## Key Elements to Incorporate

1. **Structured Element Breakdown**
   - The MJ Prompt Generator has a very detailed element-by-element approach that ensures comprehensive prompts
   - We could add a more explicit element checklist to ensure our agent covers all critical visual aspects

2. **Clear Parameter Hierarchy**
   - Their template enforces a consistent order of elements that builds a coherent visual scene
   - This matches our current approach but could be emphasized even more strongly

3. **Medium Specification**
   - They explicitly start with the "medium" (photo, digital painting, etc.) which helps set appropriate expectations
   - We could add a more explicit requirement to specify the visualization medium in each prompt

4. **Subject-Background Relationship**
   - They emphasize explicitly stating how the subject relates to the background
   - This could help our prompts create more coherent scene compositions

## Implementation Recommendations

I recommend adding a more explicit element checklist section to our document with this structure:

```markdown
## Required Prompt Elements Checklist

For each B-roll prompt, ensure you include:

1. **Medium** - Visual format (photo, digital painting, etc.)
2. **Subject** - Primary focus with detailed characteristics
3. **Subject-Background Relationship** - How subject interacts with environment
4. **Background/Environment** - Detailed scene context
5. **Lighting & Atmosphere** - Specific lighting direction, quality, and mood
6. **Technical Parameters** - Camera specs, lens details, etc.
7. **Style Elements** - Minimum 5 specific style traits
8. **MidJourney Parameters** - Required flags (--style raw --ar 16:9 --stylize [value])
```

This structured approach would ensure more consistent, comprehensive prompts that reliably produce the desired visual outcomes while still focusing exclusively on B-roll shots.

---

_**User**_

I agree. Implement these.

---

_**Assistant**_

```diff
  [Subject with detail] in [environment/setting], [lighting conditions], [perspective/viewpoint], [camera specifications], [style parameters] --style raw --ar 16:9 --stylize 750
  ```
+ 
+ ### Required Prompt Elements Checklist
+ 
+ For each B-roll prompt, ensure you include all of these elements in a structured order:
+ 
+ 1. **Medium** - Explicitly state the visual format (photo, digital painting, cinematic scene, etc.)
+ 2. **Subject** - Main focus with critical identifying features and characteristics:
+    - Precise color palette and material details
+    - Specific pose or dynamic elements
+    - Viewing angle and perspective
+ 3. **Subject-Background Relationship** - How the subject interacts with environment:
+    - Spatial positioning ("standing in front of," "emerging from," etc.)
+    - Distance relationship ("close to," "far from," etc.)
+    - Interaction dynamics ("reflecting in," "casting shadows on," etc.)
+ 4. **Background/Environment** - Detailed scene context:
+    - Setting specifics (location, time period, weather if applicable)
+    - Surrounding elements and objects
+    - Scale indicators where appropriate
+ 5. **Lighting & Atmosphere** - Specific lighting direction, quality, and mood:
+    - Dominant light source and direction
+    - Quality of light (harsh, soft, diffused, etc.)
+    - Shadow characteristics
+    - Atmospheric conditions (clear, hazy, misty, etc.)
+ 6. **Technical Parameters** - Camera and lens specifications:
+    - Camera model
+    - Lens focal length
+    - Aperture setting when relevant
+    - Specific photographic techniques
+ 7. **Style Elements** - At least 5 specific style traits:
+    - Artistic influence or reference
+    - Technical rendering approach
+    - Post-processing or color grading style
+    - Texture and detail quality
+ 8. **MidJourney Parameters** - Required flags in consistent order:
+    - `--style raw` (for photorealistic shots)
+    - `--ar 16:9` (always required)
+    - `--stylize [value]` (typical range: 650-850)
+    - `--chaos [value]` (optional)
+    - `--seed [value]` (optional)
+ 
+ #### Example Using Element Checklist:
+ 
+ ```
+ "A cinematic photograph (medium) of a weathered leather journal with handwritten notes (subject) lying open on a rustic wooden desk (subject-background relationship), in a sunlit vintage study filled with antique books and a steaming cup of coffee (background/environment). Golden afternoon sunlight streaming through dusty windows, casting long shadows with visible dust particles in the air (lighting & atmosphere). Shot on Canon 5D Mark IV with 50mm f/1.4 lens (technical parameters), analog film grain, shallow depth of field, vintage color grading, detailed page textures, atmospheric mood (style elements) --style raw --ar 16:9 --stylize 750 (MidJourney parameters)"
+ ```
+ 
+ Notice how each element builds upon the previous one to create a comprehensive and coherent image description that guides MidJourney effectively.
  
  ### 2. Photorealistic Techniques
  - Set appropriate stylization value (typically 750 for balanced detail)
  - Use `--ar 16:9` for all prompts to match the video output format requirements
- 
- ### 3. Technical Parameter Implementation
- 
- Always include these technical parameters:
- 
- - `--ar 16:9` for standard video format (required for all prompts)
- - `--style raw` for photorealism
- - `--stylize 750` for balanced detail level
- 
- For advanced control, consider:
- 
- - `--chaos [value]` to control randomness (lower for consistency)
- - `--seed [value]` for version control when iterating prompts
- 
- ### 4. Character Reference Integration
- 
- When characters are present in a shot and references exist:
- 
- - Check the Character References input for matching characters by examining the Visual Narrative's "visual_description" field for character mentions
- - Reference character attributes precisely in the prompt
- - Maintain consistent representation across shots
- - Use subtle descriptions rather than explicit naming when appropriate
  
  ## Processing Guidelines
  A focused office worker interacting with a futuristic interface with subtle blue glow, in a clean professional environment with advanced technology visible in background details, shot on Canon EOS R5 with natural lighting from large windows --style raw --ar 16:9 --stylize 750
  ```
+ 
+ ## Medium-Specific Guidance
+ 
+ Adapt your prompt structure based on the specific visual medium required:
+ 
+ ### For Photorealistic Photography
+ 
+ ```
+ "A detailed photograph of [subject] [action/pose] in [environment], [lighting details] highlighting [important features], shot on [camera model] with [lens details], [style elements] --style raw --ar 16:9 --stylize 750"
+ ```
+ 
+ Key considerations:
+ - Always include camera specifications for photorealistic results
+ - Focus on natural lighting terminology
+ - Reference real-world photography techniques
+ - Use `--style raw` parameter
+ 
+ ### For Digital Art / Illustrations
+ 
+ ```
+ "A detailed digital illustration of [subject] [action/pose] in [environment], [lighting details] creating [mood/atmosphere], rendered in [art style] with [artistic technique], [detail quality], [color treatment] --ar 16:9 --stylize 800"
+ ```
+ 
+ Key considerations:
+ - Specify artistic style clearly (e.g., "vector art," "hand-drawn," "3D render")
+ - Consider omitting `--style raw` for more artistic interpretation
+ - Use higher stylization values (800-900)
+ - Reference digital art techniques and tools
+ 
+ ### For Mixed-Media or Conceptual Visuals
+ 
+ ```
+ "A [artistic approach] visualization of [subject] [action/pose] within [conceptual environment], [lighting details] emphasizing [symbolic elements], created using [technique] with [stylistic approach], [detail characteristics], [mood elements] --ar 16:9 --stylize 850"
+ ```
+ 
+ Key considerations:
+ - Blend technical and metaphorical language
+ - Use higher stylization values for abstract concepts
+ - Balance literal descriptions with conceptual elements
+ - Consider selective use of `--style raw` based on desired realism level
  
  ## Special Effects Techniques
```

---

I've implemented the additions to the MidJourney Prompt Engineering document, incorporating key elements from the MJ Prompt Generator GPT. The changes include:

1. Added a comprehensive "Required Prompt Elements Checklist" section that breaks down the 8 essential components every prompt should include:
   - Medium specification
   - Subject details 
   - Subject-background relationship
   - Environment specifics
   - Lighting and atmosphere
   - Technical parameters
   - Style elements
   - MidJourney parameters

2. Included an annotated example that demonstrates how each element is implemented in a complete prompt.

3. Added a "Medium-Specific Guidance" section with tailored templates and considerations for:
   - Photorealistic photography
   - Digital art/illustrations
   - Mixed-media/conceptual visuals

These additions provide a more structured framework for prompt creation that ensures comprehensive coverage of all visual elements while maintaining prompt organization and effectiveness. The agent now has explicit guidance on what elements to include and how to structure them for optimal results.

---

_**User**_

OK now lets talk about the 5 variations. Did you notice that?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, I noticed that the MJ Prompt Generator GPT creates 5 distinct prompt variations for each user request. This is an excellent approach we could adopt for our workflow. The current implementation of our MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent doesn't explicitly address generating multiple variations beyond the three concept types (standard, enhanced, experimental).

There are two ways we could implement this 5-variation approach:

### Option 1: Five Variations Per Concept Type
For each B-roll shot that has multiple concept types, we could generate 5 variations of each concept. This would result in up to 15 prompts per shot (5 standard, 5 enhanced, 5 experimental).

### Option 2: Five Total Variations with Strategic Distribution
We could create 5 total prompt variations per B-roll shot, with a strategic distribution based on available concepts:
- For shots with all three concepts: 2 standard, 2 enhanced, 1 experimental
- For shots with two concepts: 3 of primary concept, 2 of secondary concept
- For shots with only one concept: All 5 variations of that concept

Option 2 is likely more practical as it provides variety while keeping the total number of prompts manageable.

The variations could differ in aspects like:
- Camera angle and framing adjustments
- Lighting direction and quality
- Mood and atmospheric elements
- Style and technical approach
- Subject focus and positioning

Would you like me to implement one of these approaches in the document?

---

_**User**_

What are the MJ GPT prompts guidance for how to creeate these variations?

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the MJ Prompt Generator GPT instructions, they create variations by strategically altering different aspects of the image while maintaining the core subject. Here's how they approach creating variations:

1. **Different mediums or rendering styles** - Changing from "cinematic photo" to "digital painting" or "3D render"

2. **Different angles or perspectives** - Varying between "aerial view," "low angle," "Dutch angle," "close-up"

3. **Different lighting conditions** - Alternating between "golden hour," "blue hour," "dramatic side lighting," "soft diffused light"

4. **Different environmental contexts** - Placing the same subject in different settings or backgrounds

5. **Different technical specifications** - Varying camera models, lens types, focal lengths, and aperture settings

We could incorporate this approach by adding a "Variation Strategy" section to our document:

```markdown
## Prompt Variation Strategy

For each B-roll concept, create variations by systematically altering these key elements:

### Variation 1: Core Concept (Baseline)
- Primary implementation of the concept as described in the Visual Narrative
- Focus on faithful representation of all core elements

### Variation 2: Perspective Shift
- Alter camera angle, height, or distance while maintaining the core subject
- Example shifts: closer/wider framing, higher/lower angle, alternative viewpoint

### Variation 3: Lighting Alternative
- Change lighting direction, quality, or time of day
- Examples: side-lit vs. backlit, hard vs. soft light, morning vs. evening

### Variation 4: Technical Approach
- Modify camera technical parameters or stylistic approach
- Examples: different lens choices, alternative depth of field, changed stylization values

### Variation 5: Mood/Atmosphere Adjustment
- Shift the emotional tone or atmospheric conditions
- Examples: warmer/cooler color palette, clear vs. atmospheric conditions, calm vs. dramatic mood
```

This structured variation approach would give us 5 distinct but related versions of each concept, providing options while maintaining the core visual intent.

---

_**User**_

Yes I like that approach. We can go with 5 prompts for each B-roll concept for now. I can pair it down later as I develop more experience on what I like. I realize this will create a lot of prompts.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll implement the 5-variation approach for each B-roll concept. This will give you maximum flexibility to explore different visual interpretations while you develop your preferences.

  This consistent ordering helps maintain prompt readability and ensures consistent processing by MidJourney.
+ 
+ ## Prompt Variation Strategy
+ 
+ For each B-roll concept (standard, enhanced, experimental), create 5 distinct variations that explore different aspects of the visual concept while maintaining the core narrative intent. This approach provides maximum flexibility for selecting the optimal visual representation.
+ 
+ ### Variation Framework
+ 
+ For each concept, create the following 5 variations:
+ 
+ #### Variation 1: Core Concept (Baseline)
+ - Faithful implementation of the concept as described in the Visual Narrative
+ - Focus on all core elements exactly as specified
+ - Standard technical parameters and lighting as described in the source
+ - Example: `"A photograph of heavy metal chains breaking apart against a dark industrial background..."`
+ 
+ #### Variation 2: Alternative Perspective/Framing
+ - Modify camera angle, height, distance, or lens choice
+ - Maintain the same subject and setting but change how it's viewed
+ - Examples:
+   - Change from wide to close-up framing or vice versa
+   - Shift from eye-level to low angle or overhead perspective
+   - Alter lens choice (wide angle vs. telephoto) for different spatial effects
+ - Example: `"An extreme close-up photograph of heavy metal chains breaking apart..."`
+ 
+ #### Variation 3: Lighting and Mood Shift
+ - Keep the same subject and composition but alter the lighting approach
+ - Change time of day, light direction, quality, or color temperature
+ - Create a distinctly different mood or emotional tone
+ - Examples:
+   - Shift from bright daylight to dramatic low-key lighting
+   - Change from neutral to colored lighting
+   - Alter from soft diffused to hard directional lighting
+ - Example: `"A photograph of heavy metal chains breaking apart with dramatic red backlighting..."`
+ 
+ #### Variation 4: Stylistic Treatment
+ - Modify the artistic approach or technical rendering style
+ - Maintain core subject and composition but change how it's rendered
+ - Examples:
+   - Shift between photorealistic and stylized rendering
+   - Alter from standard to high-contrast or monochromatic treatment
+   - Change from clean to textured or grainy aesthetic
+ - Example: `"A high-contrast black and white photograph of heavy metal chains breaking apart..."`
+ 
+ #### Variation 5: Conceptual Extension
+ - Thoughtfully extend the concept with additional elements that enhance meaning
+ - Add symbolic elements, contextual details, or compositional elements
+ - Ensure additions serve the narrative purpose without overwhelming
+ - Examples:
+   - Include symbolic elements that reinforce the metaphor
+   - Add environmental details that provide greater context
+   - Introduce dynamic elements that enhance the concept
+ - Example: `"A photograph of heavy metal chains breaking apart, with each fragmented piece transforming into a butterfly..."`
+ 
+ ### Implementation Guidelines
+ 
+ When creating the 5 variations:
+ 
+ 1. **Maintain Core Identity**
+    - All variations should be clearly recognizable as implementing the same basic concept
+    - Key narrative elements must remain consistent across variations
+    - Variations should explore different visual approaches, not different subjects
+ 
+ 2. **Calibrate Variation Range**
+    - Ensure variations are meaningfully different, not minor tweaks
+    - Avoid extreme departures that change the fundamental concept
+    - Create a balanced set of options that explores different aspects
+ 
+ 3. **Technical Parameter Adjustments**
+    - Adjust stylization values appropriately for each variation (typically 700-850)
+    - Consider different chaos values for variations that benefit from more randomness
+    - Use consistent aspect ratio (`--ar 16:9`) across all variations
+ 
+ 4. **Documentation in Output**
+    - Include a `variation_type` field for each prompt (e.g., "core", "perspective", "lighting", "style", "conceptual")
+    - Maintain consistent scene_id and shot_id across all variations
+    - Use the version_number field to track iteration if feedback is received
+ 
+ ### Example: Five Variations for a Single Concept

  ## Handling Image Review Feedback
```

---

I've implemented the 5-variation approach for each B-roll concept. This structured system gives you maximum flexibility while maintaining organization of the large number of prompts that will be generated.

The new section includes:

1. **Variation Framework** with five specific variation types:
   - Core Concept (baseline implementation)
   - Alternative Perspective/Framing (different camera angles/distances)
   - Lighting and Mood Shift (different lighting approaches)
   - Stylistic Treatment (alternate rendering styles)
   - Conceptual Extension (enhanced metaphorical elements)

2. **Implementation Guidelines** for creating effective variations:
   - Maintaining core identity across variations
   - Creating meaningfully different options
   - Adjusting technical parameters appropriately
   - Documenting variation types in the output

3. **Complete Example** showing all five variations for a single concept, demonstrating how each variation type creates a distinct visual interpretation while maintaining the core narrative intent.

This approach will create up to 15 prompts per B-roll shot (5 variations Ã— 3 concept types), giving you a wide range of options to select from as you develop your preferences. As you gain experience, you can reduce the number of variations to focus on your preferred approaches.

Let me try a more direct approach:

---

Read file: MidJourneyPromptEngineering.md

---

```diff
  
  Example of prioritized prompt construction:
+ 
  ```
  "Executive (primary subject) analyzing holographic data visualization (high-priority detail) in modern office with city view (environment), afternoon side lighting creating defined shadows (main lighting), shot on Canon R5 with 50mm lens (camera specifics) --style raw --ar 16:9 --stylize 750"
  
  Original concept from Visual Narrative:
+ 
  ```
  "Heavy metal chains depicted against a dark industrial background, shown in slow motion breaking apart, symbolizing freedom from the grasp of addiction."
  
  Original prompt:
+ 
  ```
  "Executive analyzing holographic data, modern office environment with city view --style raw --ar 16:9 --stylize 750"
  ```
  
  Feedback:
+ 
  ```
  "The holographic data isn't visible enough, and the office feels too generic. Also, the lighting is too flat."
  ```
  
  Revised prompt:
+ 
  ```
  "Executive analyzing large, luminescent blue holographic data visualization floating prominently in foreground, minimalist modern office with distinctive skyline view through floor-to-ceiling windows, dramatic side lighting creating defined shadows across subject's face, afternoon golden hour sunlight adding depth and dimension --style raw --ar 16:9 --stylize 800"
```

Let me continue with more fixes:

Let me try a direct edit to just one section:

---

I'm going to try a more comprehensive approach:

---

Model provided invalid arguments for tool call.

---

Let me simplify the approach:

---

```bash
echo "Fixing MD031 errors" && python -c "file_path = 'MidJourneyPromptEngineering.md'; content = open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8').read(); import re; fixed_content = re.sub(r'([^\n])\n```', r'\1\n\n```', content); fixed_content = re.sub(r'```\n([^\n])', r'```\n\n\1', fixed_content); open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8').write(fixed_content); print('Fixed MD031 errors by adding blank lines around code blocks')"
```

```
oduction-WF>echo "Fixing MD031 errors" && python -c "file_path = 'MidJourneyPromptEngineering.md'; co
           n(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8').read(); import re; fixed_content = re.sub(r'([^\n])\n`
echo "Fixing MD031 errors" && python -c "file_path = 'MidJourneyPromptEngineering.md'; content = open
 code blocks')"
"Fixing MD031 errors"
Fixed MD031 errors by adding blank lines around code blocks

G:\My Drive\Retail Therapy Unplugged\Agentic Integration\Meta-Prompt-Workflow\WorkflowFather\Video-Pr
oduction-WF>
```

---

Great! I've run a Python script that automatically fixed the MD031 errors by:

1. Finding all instances where code blocks (starting with ```) didn't have a blank line before them
2. Finding all instances where code blocks (ending with ```) didn't have a blank line after them
3. Adding the necessary blank lines in both cases

This ensures that all code blocks in the MidJourneyPromptEngineering.md file are properly surrounded by blank lines, which resolves the MD031 markdown linting error:

```
MD031/blanks-around-fences: Fenced code blocks should be surrounded by blank lines
```

The document should now pass the markdown linting check for this specific error. This change maintains the content exactly as is while ensuring proper formatting according to markdown best practices.

Look at the output for the agent. Do you see any problems?

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the test output from the MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent, I notice several issues:

1. **Missing Variation Types**: The output doesn't implement the 5-variation framework we just added (core, perspective, lighting, style, conceptual). Each B-roll concept has only one prompt variation instead of the five we specified.

2. **Inconsistent Format**: The JSON structure is correct, but it lacks the `variation_type` field we specified should be included in the output.

3. **Prompt Content Formatting**: Some of the prompts are excessively long and may risk losing important details due to token limitations in MidJourney. They could be more focused and structured.

4. **Element Coverage**: While the prompts contain most required elements, they don't explicitly follow the ordered checklist structure we established (medium, subject, subject-background relationship, etc.).

5. **Parameter Consistency**: Some experimental concept prompts omit the `--style raw` parameter without clear justification, though this might be intentional for more artistic interpretations.

6. **Variable Stylization Values**: The values for `--stylize` are appropriate (750 for standard, 800 for enhanced, 850 for experimental), but there's no documentation of the reasoning in the output.

These issues indicate that while the agent is correctly filtering for B-roll shots and generating a prompt for each concept type, it hasn't fully implemented the structured approach and variation strategy we've designed in our updated documentation.

I will add a 7th issue. Several of the outputs have a preamble and postscript. The agent should only be outpinng JSON. My comments on the other 6 issues:

1 & 2. Agree completely.
3. Agreed, though increasing the number of prompts may naturally have the effect of shortening them individually. If not already present there should be some prioritization of the elements in the prompt structure.
4. Agreed.
5. I am ok with experimental shots not using style raw since they may be abstract so it's appropriate.
6. These stylize values seem very high for cinematic and photrealistic images. You should check the web sources to see what is appropraite. For experimental concepts the high stylize value could be OK since it may be abstract anyway.

_**Assistant**_

You're right about all these issues, especially the JSON-only output requirement. Let me address each point:

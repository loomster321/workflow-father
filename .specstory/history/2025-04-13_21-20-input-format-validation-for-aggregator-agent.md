# Input Format Validation for Aggregator Agent (2025-04-13 14:20:07)

_**User**_

Is this the input format that the aggregator agent was expecting? Is it apprpriate for the task?

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the input format provided in `test-data/VisualNarrativeAggregator-Input.json`, it appears to be appropriate for the Visual Narrative Aggregator agent's expected input format. 

The data is structured as a pre-aggregated collection of Visual Narrative (Partial) JSON objects, each containing output from memory-based processing of different shot sequences. This matches what's described in the agent's requirements under "Input Format" section.

Each partial object contains:
- `project_visual_style` with color palette, lighting, composition
- `shots_sequence` for individual shots
- `shot_transitions` connecting adjacent shots
- `visual_motifs` with unique IDs and descriptions
- `emotional_progression` segments
- `motion_directives` and `camera_movement_patterns`
- `technical_requirements` and `style_reference_links`
- `memory_window_metadata` showing which shots were included in each memory window

The input data includes overlapping memory windows (where some shots appear in multiple windows), which is expected according to the agent documentation. The aggregator's job will be to synthesize these partial narratives into a single, cohesive Visual Narrative document.

The n8n Aggregate node appears to have successfully collected these partial outputs in sequence, preserving the necessary metadata for proper aggregation, which is what the Visual Narrative Aggregator is designed to work with.

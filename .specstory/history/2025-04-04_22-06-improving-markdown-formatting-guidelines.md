_**User**_

Considering these common markdown erros can you recommend changes to the Markdown Formatting Guidelines ?

_**Assistant**_

Based on your query, I need to understand common Markdown errors first to recommend improvements to the Markdown Formatting Guidelines. Let me first check if there are any existing Markdown guidelines in the workspace.

</details>

Let me first read the common Markdown errors document to understand what issues need to be addressed.

---

Read file: Markdown-errors.json

---

Now let me check the current Markdown formatting guidelines to understand what improvements to recommend.

---

Read file: markdown-formatting.md

---

Based on the Markdown error data and the current guidelines, I'll recommend improvements to the Markdown Formatting Guidelines to address the common errors found in your codebase.

  # Markdown Formatting Guidelines 
+ 
+ ## General Structure
  - Use proper Markdown syntax for all system instructions
  - Structure documents with clear hierarchical headings (# for main title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)
+ - **Always add blank lines before and after headings** to ensure proper rendering
  - Use bold (**text**) for emphasis on important concepts and requirements
  - Use italic (*text*) for parameter names and minor emphasis
  - Format code snippets and examples with proper code blocks (```javascript) including language specification
+ 
+ ## Lists and Spacing
+ - **Always surround lists with blank lines** (before the first item and after the last item)
  - Use bullet points for lists of related items
  - Use numbered lists for sequential steps or prioritized items
+ - **Use consistent indentation for lists** (typically 2 spaces for nested items)
+ - **Avoid using tabs for indentation** - use spaces instead
+ - Ensure proper spacing after list markers (e.g., "- Item" not "-Item")
+ 
+ ## Headings
+ - **Never include trailing punctuation in headings** (avoid ending with :, ., etc.)
+ - Ensure consistent capitalization in headings (recommend title case)
+ - Include a space after the # symbol (e.g., "# Heading" not "#Heading")
+ - **Always add blank lines before and after headings**
+ 
+ ## Formatting Elements
  - Use blockquotes (> text) for important notes, cautions, and examples
  - Create tables with proper markdown syntax for structured data and parameter definitions
  - Use horizontal rules (---) to separate major sections when appropriate
  - Include proper linking syntax for references to documentation
+ - **Avoid trailing spaces** at the end of lines
+ - Ensure each file **ends with a single newline character**
+ 
+ ## Code and Technical Elements
  - Maintain consistent formatting patterns throughout the document
  - Use inline code formatting (`text`) for short code references, parameters, and values
  - Use code comments within code blocks to explain logic
  - Ensure proper indentation in both markdown and code examples
+ 
+ ## HTML Usage
  - Use HTML sparingly and only when markdown limitations require it
+ - **When using HTML elements, ensure they are properly closed**
+ - Consider using pure Markdown alternatives when possible instead of HTML
+ 
+ ## Common Error Prevention
+ - Run markdown linting tools before committing documentation changes
+ - Pay special attention to MD022 (blank lines around headings), MD032 (blank lines around lists), and MD007 (list indentation) errors
+ - Avoid hard tabs (MD010) and use spaces for indentation instead
+ - Remove trailing spaces at the end of lines (MD009)
+ - Don't use trailing punctuation in headings (MD026)
```

I've updated the Markdown Formatting Guidelines to address the common errors found in your codebase. The main improvements include:

1. **Organized into clear sections** - Structured the guidelines into focused categories for easier reference

2. **Added explicit rules about spacing** - Emphasized the importance of blank lines around headings and lists, which were frequent errors in your code

3. **List formatting clarification** - Added specific guidance on proper list indentation and formatting, addressing the MD007 and MD032 errors

4. **Heading guidelines** - Added specific rules about not using trailing punctuation in headings (MD026) and proper spacing

5. **File formatting standards** - Added guidelines about avoiding trailing spaces (MD009) and ensuring files end with a single newline (MD047)

6. **HTML usage** - Expanded guidance on proper HTML usage within Markdown

7. **Common Error Prevention section** - Added a new section specifically highlighting the most common errors found in your codebase with their error codes for easier recognition

These updates should help prevent the most common Markdown linting errors found in your documentation, leading to more consistent and properly formatted Markdown files throughout your codebase.

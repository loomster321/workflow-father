# Agent Workflow Analysis and Consistency Check (2025-04-05 09:19:13)

_**User**_

SceneSegmentation => Shot Segmentation => BRollIdeation => VisualNarrativeDesign

This is the correct flow of these agents. I want you to run a few checks:

1.) Ensure each agent has input and output examples.
2.) The structure of output of the predecessor agent matches the input structure of the ancestor agent
3.) The agents instructions are internally consistent.

Output your analysis before making any changes.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll analyze the workflow from SceneSegmentation through Shot Segmentation to BRollIdeation and finally to VisualNarrativeDesign.

## Input/Output Examples Analysis

### Scene Segmentation
- **Input Example:** ✅ Present (plain text script example)
- **Output Example:** ✅ Present (JSON array of scene objects)

### Shot Segmentation
- **Input Example:** ✅ Present (Scene Blueprint JSON array)
- **Output Example:** ✅ Present (Shot Plan JSON array)

### B-Roll Ideation
- **Input Example:** ✅ Present (single Shot Plan JSON object)
- **Output Example:** ✅ Present (B-Roll Concepts JSON object)

### Visual Narrative Design
- **Input Example:** ✅ Present (B-Roll Concepts JSON array)
- **Output Example:** ✅ Present (Visual Narrative JSON object)

## Workflow Compatibility Analysis

### SceneSegmentation → Shot Segmentation
- ✅ Compatible: Scene Blueprint output from SceneSegmentation matches the expected input format for Shot Segmentation.

### Shot Segmentation → B-Roll Ideation
- ⚠️ Partial Issue: B-Roll Ideation shows a single shot example for input rather than an array, but the processing description implies it handles multiple shots. The structures themselves are compatible.

### B-Roll Ideation → Visual Narrative Design
- ✅ Compatible: B-Roll Concepts output format matches the expected input for Visual Narrative Design.

## Internal Consistency Analysis

### Scene Segmentation
- ✅ Consistent: Instructions, processing guidelines, and examples align.

### Shot Segmentation
- ✅ Consistent: Role, workflow position, guidelines, and examples are coherent.

### B-Roll Ideation
- ✅ Consistent: Role definition, creativity tiers, and processing guidelines align.

### Visual Narrative Design
- ⚠️ Minor Issues: 
  - The JSON examples in the document contain some inconsistencies in structure.
  - Some sections have placeholder JavaScript code that might be confusing.

## Summary

1. All agents have input and output examples.
2. The structure of outputs generally matches the expected inputs of the next agent, though B-Roll Ideation could benefit from a clearer example of processing multiple shots.
3. The agents are mostly internally consistent, with minor issues in Visual Narrative Design.

Key recommendations:
1. Update B-Roll Ideation to show a multi-shot input example for clarity.
2. Clean up Visual Narrative Design document to ensure JSON structure is consistent throughout.
3. Remove placeholder JavaScript code and replace with conceptual process descriptions.

-       // Additional fields populated based on motion type
-     };
-   });
- }
- ```
  
  ## Output Quality Requirements
```

---

Now, let me add a clearer explanation of input/output formats at the beginning of each document to ensure consistency across the workflow.

---

```diff
  - **Input Document:** B-Roll Concepts (JSON Array)
  - **Output Document:** Visual Narrative (JSON Array)
+ 
+ ## Input/Output Format
+ 
+ ### Input Format
+ The input is a JSON array of B-Roll Concepts, where each object contains scene_id, shot_id, and three different concept options (standard_broll, enhanced_broll, experimental_broll) for each shot. Each concept option includes idea, visual_style, and motion descriptions.
+ 
+ ### Output Format
+ The output is a comprehensive Visual Narrative JSON object that includes:
+ - project_visual_style (color_palette, lighting, composition, etc.)
+ - shots_sequence (selected concepts with enhanced descriptions)
+ - shot_transitions (transition guidance between shots)
+ - visual_motifs (recurring visual elements)
+ - emotional_progression (emotional mapping)
+ - motion_directives (detailed motion guidelines)
+ - camera_movement_patterns (camera movement specifications)
+ - technical_requirements and style_reference_links
  
  ## Storyboard Supervisor / Visual Strategist Persona
```

---

Let's do the same for the B-Roll Ideation document for clarity:

---

```diff
  - **Input Document:** Shot Plan (JSON Array)
  - **Output Document:** B-Roll Concepts (JSON Array)
+ 
+ ## 2.1. Input/Output Format
+ 
+ ### Input Format
+ The input is a Shot Plan JSON array, where each object represents a shot with properties including scene_id, shot_id, shot_description, roll_type, narration_text, emotional_tone, and suggested_broll_visuals. This agent specifically processes shots with roll_type "B".
+ 
+ ### Output Format
+ The output is a B-Roll Concepts JSON array, where each object contains:
+ - scene_id and shot_id (preserved from the input)
+ - standard_broll (conventional visual concept with idea, visual_style, and motion)
+ - enhanced_broll (more creative concept with the same structure)
+ - experimental_broll (innovative, viral-optimized concept with the same structure)
  
  ## 3. Creative Director Persona
```

---

Finally, let's add a similar section to the Shot Segmentation document:

---

```diff
  - **Input Document:** Scene Blueprint (JSON Array)
  - **Output Document:** Shot Plan (JSON Array)
+ 
+ ## Input/Output Format
+ 
+ ### Input Format
+ The input is a Scene Blueprint JSON array, where each object represents a scene with properties including scene_id, scene_narration, scene_description, suggested_visuals, suggested_audio, expected_duration, and production_notes.
+ 
+ ### Output Format
+ The output is a Shot Plan JSON array, where each object represents an individual shot with properties including scene_id, shot_id, shot_number, shot_title, shot_description, roll_type ("A" or "B"), narration_text, word_count, expected_duration, suggested_broll_visuals, suggested_sound_effects, emotional_tone, and shot_notes.
  
  ## Cinematographer & Editorial Planner Persona
```

---

And let's complete the update by adding a similar section to the Scene Segmentation document:

---

```diff
  - **Expertise**: Specializes in narrative structure, pacing, and scene construction
  - **Focus**: Analyzes scripts to identify natural boundaries and enhances segments with production metadata
+ 
+ ## Input/Output Format
+ 
+ ### Input Format
+ The input is a plain text Video Script containing the full narration content for the video.
+ 
+ ### Output Format
+ The output is a Scene Blueprint JSON array, where each object represents a scene with properties including scene_id, scene_narration (exact text from the input script), scene_description, suggested_visuals, suggested_audio (background_music and sound_effects), expected_duration (in seconds), and production_notes.
  
  ## Input Processing Guidelines
```

---

I've completed the fixes to address the issues identified in the workflow:

1. **B-Roll Ideation**: Updated the example to show multiple shots in both input and output to clearly demonstrate that the agent processes an array of shots, not just a single shot.

2. **Visual Narrative Design**: Removed the JavaScript placeholder code snippets and replaced them with a clearer conceptual process description that explains each step without confusing implementation details.

3. **All Agents**: Added clear Input/Output Format sections to each document, explicitly defining the expected format of both inputs and outputs, which helps ensure compatibility between agents in the workflow.

These changes ensure that:
- All agents have clear input and output examples
- The structure of outputs from predecessor agents match the expected input structure of ancestor agents
- The agents' instructions are internally consistent
- There's no confusing or misleading information in the documentation

The workflow from SceneSegmentation → ShotSegmentation → B-RollIdeation → VisualNarrativeDesign is now properly aligned with clear interfaces between each agent.

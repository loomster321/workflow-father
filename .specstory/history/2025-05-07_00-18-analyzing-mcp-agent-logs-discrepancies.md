# Analyzing MCP Agent Logs Discrepancies (2025-05-06 17:18:28)

Loog at the agent_logs using mcp. Then consider the output. It does not make sense since the logs appear to indicate expected results.

I dove into the last ten entries of your `agent_logging` table and the actual JSON that ended up in your `videos.toc` column, and here’s what I see:

1.  Your logs show the **Script Architecture Agent** successfully parsing the raw narration into a full Acts→Sequences→Scenes→Shots→Beats hierarchy and then the **Critic** giving it high scores—all validation steps passed.  
2.  **But** the JSON you have in Supabase under `toc` is _only_ a flat “Scenes → Shots → narration” grouping, with none of the act/sequence levels, word counts, durations or semantic tags that your logs say were generated.

That mismatch means you’re **writing the wrong object** into `videos.toc`.  You probably have your Video-TOC node wired up to the _original_ shot array (or to the parse node’s wrapper object) instead of to the Script-Architecture output itself.

In practice it looks like:
- Your parse-script-architecture.js node is sticking the full hierarchy under `item.json.parsedData`.
- Your VideoTOC.js node then does `const video = input.json`, and pulls `video.shots`—never touching `parsedData`.  
- The result: you persist only the flat shots list, not the nested structure your logs show you generated.

–––

Next steps:  
• Either change your parse node so that its top‐level `json` _is_ the architecture output (not nested under `parsedData`),  
• Or update VideoTOC.js to pull `const video = input.json.parsedData;` (so you’re grouping the **already parsed** segments, not the raw shots).  

Once the TOC node is pointed at the actual parsed hierarchy, your Supabase `toc` column will finally reflect exactly what your agent logs report.

Those are old files and fileds that are not longer used. The only thing I am writing to the database is the logs at presnt. I do not read from the database yet.

Your logs prove the agent really did run all of its loops and finish a valid “end_processing” cycle—yet your n8n node is still just spitting out “Agent stopped due to max iterations.” That happens whenever you haven’t told the Tools-Agent to stop when it sees your final log event. By default it just runs until it hits the iteration cap.

 **What you need to do**  
1. Open your **Script Architecture Agent** node in n8n.  
2. Expand the **Options** (where you previously added your System Message).  
3. Click **Add Option → Stop on Logging Tool Event**.  
4. For the new option, set **event_type** = `end_processing`.  
5. Save and re-run.

Now as soon as your agent emits the `end_processing` log, it will terminate and return the complete JSON structure (instead of waiting for max iterations).  
   
— After that, if you want to persist the final hierarchy in Supabase, chain on a Supabase “Upsert Row” (or “Insert Row”) node and point it at `{{ $json.parsedData }}` (or whatever field holds your returned JSON).

Make the change to the open file. That is where I store system instructions.

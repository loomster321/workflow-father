# Critic Agent Tool Usage Failure (2025-05-07 18:48:04)

_**User**_

The critic did not call any tools. Why?

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at ScriptStructureCritic.md, the agent requires the use of two tools during its evaluation process:

1. **Critic Calculator Tool**: For duration estimation and quantitative checks
2. **Critic Logging Tool**: For recording key events, decisions, and evaluation outcomes

The agent is expected to make specific logging calls at required points:
- Start of processing
- After validation checks
- After evaluating each criterion
- During final evaluation
- End of processing

If the agent didn't call any tools, this is a failure to follow the instruction requirements. The document explicitly states under "Core Processing Responsibilities" that the agent must handle "Logging all key events, tool usage, decisions, and detected issues" and there are detailed sections explaining when and how to use the logging tools.

The agent must separate the logging calls from the final JSON output, but both processes need to occur - first making the logging calls throughout the evaluation process, then returning only the clean JSON structure as the final output.

---

_**User**_

Can I ask it to exaplin why it did not call the tools in the out just for debugging purposes?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, you can ask the Script Structure Critic agent to explain why it didn't call the required tools. 

For debugging purposes, you could instruct the agent to provide a detailed explanation of its thought process, including why it skipped the required tool calls (Critic Calculator Tool and Critic Logging Tool). This would help identify whether:

1. The agent didn't understand the tool requirements
2. There was an issue with tool access/configuration
3. The agent simply overlooked the logging requirements

When asking for this debugging information, you should specify that this is a one-time debugging request and doesn't change the normal expected behavior (which is to make proper tool calls followed by returning only the clean JSON output).

---

_**User**_

How do I implement that?

---

_**Assistant**_

To implement the logging functionality for the Script Structure Critic Agent, you need to create the required tools (Critic Calculator Tool and Critic Logging Tool) and ensure they're available in the n8n workflow. Here's how to do it:

1. Create the Critic Logging Tool in n8n:

### Rule: n8n-code-nodes

**This rule applies to n8n Javascript code nodes.**

```markdown
# Comprehensive Cursor Rules for n8n JavaScript Code Nodes

## Introduction
This document provides detailed cursor rules and best practices for writing JavaScript code in n8n Code Nodes. Following these guidelines will ensure your code is optimized, maintainable, secure, and follows established n8n conventions. Consistent coding practices are especially important in n8n workflows where they enable collaboration, troubleshooting, and long-term maintainability of your automation ecosystem.

## Core Principles
- **Clarity**: Write code that is easy to understand and maintain
- **Immutability**: Never mutate input data directly
- **Performance**: Optimize for execution speed and resource usage
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error prevention strategies
- **Maintainability**: Structure your code for easy updates and modifications
- **Testability**: Write code that can be easily tested and validated
- **Documentation**: Add appropriate comments for complex logic
- **Security** (Optional): Implement security measures when explicitly requested

---

## Code Structure & Organization

### File Structure
```javascript
// 1. Imports and Constants
const moment = require('moment');
const BATCH_SIZE = 100;
const CODE_VERSION = '1.0.0';

// 2. Configuration
const CONFIG = {
  retryAttempts: 3,
  timeoutMs: 5000,
  debug: false
};

// 3. Helper Functions
function validateInput(item) {
  // Input validation logic
}

// 4. Main Execution Logic
const processedItems = $input.all().map(item => {
  // Processing logic
});

// 5. Error Handling
try {
  // Validate final output
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error in processing:', error.message);
  // Handle error appropriately
}

// 6. Return Statement
return { json: processedItems };
```

### Code Documentation
- Add a brief description at the top explaining what the code does
- Document complex logic with inline comments
- Use JSDoc-style comments for functions:

```javascript
/**
 * Transforms raw customer data into standardized format
 * @param {Object} customer - Raw customer data
 * @param {string} customer.id - Unique customer identifier
 * @param {Object} [options] - Optional configuration
 * @returns {Object} Standardized customer object
 */
function transformCustomer(customer, options = {}) {
  // Function implementation
}
```

### Naming Conventions
- Use **camelCase** for variables, functions, and methods
- Use **PascalCase** for classes and constructors
- Use **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for constants
- Use **descriptive prefixes** for boolean variables:
  - `is` for state (e.g., `isProcessed`)
  - `has` for presence (e.g., `hasError`)
  - `should` for conditions (e.g., `shouldRetry`)

### Function Structure
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function should do one thing well
- **Pure Functions**: Avoid side effects where possible
- **Early Returns**: Handle edge cases early to reduce nesting
- **Parameter Limits**: Keep function parameters to a maximum of 3

```javascript
// ✅ Good: Pure function with early returns
function formatAmount(value, currency = 'USD') {
  if (value === null || value === undefined) return '0.00';
  if (typeof value !== 'number') return value.toString();
  
  return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {
    style: 'currency',
    currency: currency
  }).format(value);
}
```

---

## Input Handling

### Execution Modes
- **Run Once for All Items**:
  ```javascript
  const allItems = $input.all(); // Returns array of all input items
  // Process all items at once
  return { json: processedItems };
  ```

- **Run Once for Each Item**:
  ```javascript
  const currentItem = $input.item; // Current item being processed
  // Process single item
  return { json: processedItem };
  ```

### Immutable Data Handling
**NEVER** mutate original input data directly. Always create copies:

```javascript
// ❌ Dangerous: Direct modification
$input.item.json.price *= 1.1;

// ✅ Safe: Cloning approach
const modifiedItem = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify($input.item.json));
modifiedItem.price *= 1.1;
return { json: modifiedItem };
```

```javascript
// ✅ Better: Using spread operator
const modifiedItem = {
  ...$input.item.json,
  price: $input.item.json.price * 1.1,
  updatedAt: new Date().toISOString()
};
return { json: modifiedItem };
```

### Efficient Data Access Patterns

| Method | Use Case | Complexity | Notes |
|-----|----|---|----|
| `$input.first()` | First item | O(1) | Prefer over `$input.all()[0]` |
| `$input.last()` | Last item | O(n) | Use cautiously with large datasets |
| `$input.item` | Current item | O(1) | In "Run once for each" mode |
| `$input.all()` | All items | O(n) | In "Run once for all" mode |
| `$input.itemIndex` | Current index | O(1) | In "Run once for each" mode |

```javascript
// ✅ Good: Clear intent for first item
const firstItem = $input.first();

// ❌ Poor: Less readable and redundant processing
const firstItem = $input.all()[0];
```

### Context-Aware Processing

```javascript
// Check workflow context 
if ($input.context.noItemsLeft) {
  // Finalize batch processing
  return { json: { status: 'completed', totalProcessed: $input.context.totalProcessed } };
}

// Access workflow variables
const apiKey = $workflow.variables.apiKey;
```

---

## Error Prevention and Handling

### Standardized Error Classification

Define clear error categories to improve error handling consistency:

```javascript
// Define error types
const ErrorTypes = {
  VALIDATION: 'VALIDATION_ERROR',
  PROCESSING: 'PROCESSING_ERROR',
  EXTERNAL: 'EXTERNAL_SERVICE_ERROR',
  CONFIGURATION: 'CONFIGURATION_ERROR'
};

// Create custom error class
class WorkflowError extends Error {
  constructor(message, type, details = {}) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'WorkflowError';
    this.type = type;
    this.details = details;
    this.timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
  }
}

// Example usage
if (!item.json?.orderId) {
  throw new WorkflowError(
    'Missing order ID', 
    ErrorTypes.VALIDATION, 
    { item: item.json }
  );
}
```

### Type Safety and Validation

```javascript
// Validate input structure before processing
function validateOrderItem(item) {
  if (!item.json) {
    throw new WorkflowError(
      'Invalid item: missing json property',
      ErrorTypes.VALIDATION
    );
  }
  
  if (typeof item.json.orderId !== 'string') {
    throw new WorkflowError(
      `Invalid order ID format: ${typeof item.json.orderId}`,
      ErrorTypes.VALIDATION,
      { expectedType: 'string', receivedType: typeof item.json.orderId }
    );
  }
  
  if (typeof item.json.quantity !== 'number' || item.json.quantity <= 0) {
    throw new WorkflowError(
      `Invalid quantity: ${item.json.quantity}`,
      ErrorTypes.VALIDATION,
      { value: item.json.quantity }
    );
  }
  
  return true;
}

// Apply validation to all items
const allItems = $input.all();
allItems.forEach(validateOrderItem);
```

### Null Safety

```javascript
// Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing
const orderValue = $input.item.json?.orderDetails?.total ?? 0;
const customerName = $input.item.json?.customer?.name || 'Anonymous';

// Safely access nested properties
function getNestedProperty(obj, path, defaultValue = null) {
  return path.split('.').reduce((prev, curr) => 
    prev ? prev[curr] : defaultValue, obj);
}

const zipCode = getNestedProperty($input.item.json, 'address.zipCode', '00000');
```

### Try-Catch Blocks

Always wrap risky operations in try-catch blocks with appropriate error handling:

```javascript
try {
  // Risky operation (e.g., JSON parsing)
  const config = JSON.parse($input.item.json.configString);
  return { json: { success: true, config } };
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to parse config:', error.message);
  return { 
    json: { 
      success: false, 
      error: error.message,
      originalData: $input.item.json.configString
    } 
  };
}
```

### Graceful Degradation

Design your code to handle partial failures gracefully:

```javascript
// Process multiple items, continuing even if some fail
function processWithFallbacks(items) {
  return items.map(item => {
    try {
      return processItem(item);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Failed to process item ${item.json?.id}:`, error.message);
      // Return a fallback or partial result instead of failing completely
      return {
        json: {
          id: item.json?.id,
          processingError: error.message,
          status: 'FAILED',
          partialData: extractSafeData(item)
        }
      };
    }
  });
}

// Extract whatever data is safe to use even when processing fails
function extractSafeData(item) {
  const safe = {};
  // Copy only the fields we know are safe
  if (item.json?.id) safe.id = item.json.id;
  if (item.json?.name) safe.name = item.json.name;
  return safe;
}
```

---

## Performance Optimization

### Batch Processing

```javascript
// Process items in batches of 100
const batchSize = 100;
const allItems = $input.all();
const batches = [];

// Create batches
for (let i = 0; i < allItems.length; i += batchSize) {
  batches.push(allItems.slice(i, i + batchSize));
}

// Process each batch
const results = batches.map(batch => {
  return batch.map(processSingleItem);
});

// Flatten results
return { json: results.flat() };
```

### Task Runners for Improved Performance

In n8n version 1.0 and later, you can take advantage of Task Runners for JavaScript Code Nodes to achieve up to 6x performance improvement:

```javascript
// Use the Task Runner API if available
if ($taskRunner) {
  // Define a task that can be run in parallel
  const processItemTask = $taskRunner.define(item => {
    // Complex processing logic
    return transformItem(item);
  });
  
  // Process all items in parallel
  const results = await $taskRunner.runAll(
    $input.all(),
    processItemTask,
    { concurrency: 5 } // Process 5 items at a time
  );
  
  return { json: results };
} else {
  // Fallback for older n8n versions
  return { json: $input.all().map(transformItem) };
}
```

### Benchmarking Critical Code

Measure performance of critical code sections to identify bottlenecks:

```javascript
function timeExecution(fn, label) {
  const start = performance.now();
  const result = fn();
  const duration = performance.now() - start;
  console.log(`${label} took ${duration.toFixed(2)}ms to execute`);
  return result;
}

// Usage
const transformedData = timeExecution(() => {
  return $input.all().map(complexTransformation);
}, 'Data transformation');
```

### Memory Management

```javascript
// For very large datasets, use generators
function* processLargeDataset(items) {
  for (const item of items) {
    // Process one item at a time to avoid memory spikes
    yield transformItem(item);
  }
}

// Convert generator results to array
const results = [...processLargeDataset($input.all())];
return { json: results };
```

### Reduce Object Creation

```javascript
// ❌ Inefficient: Creates many temporary objects
const processedItems = $input.all().map(item => {
  const temp1 = doSomething(item);
  const temp2 = doSomethingElse(temp1);
  const temp3 = yetAnotherOperation(temp2);
  return finalTransform(temp3);
});

// ✅ Better: Chains operations to reduce temporary objects
const processedItems = $input.all().map(item => 
  finalTransform(
    yetAnotherOperation(
      doSomethingElse(
        doSomething(item)
      )
    )
  )
);

// ✅ Also good: Use reduce for complex transformations
const processedItems = $input.all().reduce((result, item) => {
  // Complex transformation logic that builds up the result
  result.push(transformItem(item));
  return result;
}, []);
```

---

## Cross-Node Integration

### Referencing External Node Data

```javascript
// Access data from previous nodes
const userData = $("User Lookup").item.json;
const allProducts = $("Product API").all();

// Get data from specific item by index
const specificItem = $("Item Generator").item($input.itemIndex).json;
```

### Parameter Forwarding

```javascript
// Preserve configuration from previous nodes
const queryParams = $input.params;
const apiEndpoint = $("API Config").first().json.endpoint;

// Forward metadata
return {
  json: {
    ...processedData,
    _meta: {
      source: $input.item.json._meta,
      processedAt: new Date().toISOString()
    }
  }
};
```

---

## Debugging & Logging

### Structured Logging Levels

Use different logging methods for different severity levels:

```javascript
// Define logging utility with severity levels
const logger = {
  debug: (message, data) => {
    if (CONFIG.debug) console.log(`[DEBUG] ${message}`, data);
  },
  info: (message, data) => {
    console.log(`[INFO] ${message}`, data);
  },
  warn: (message, data) => {
    console.warn(`[WARNING] ${message}`, data);
  },
  error: (message, data) => {
    console.error(`[ERROR] ${message}`, data);
  }
};

// Usage examples
logger.info('Processing started', {
  itemCount: $input.all().length,
  workflowId: $workflow.id,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
});

logger.debug('Raw input data', $input.first().json);

try {
  // Risky operation
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Operation failed', {
    error: error.message,
    itemId: $input.item.json.id,
    stack: error.stack
  });
}
```

### Conditional Debug Output

Toggle verbose output based on configuration:

```javascript
// Define debug configuration
const DEBUG = $workflow.variables.debugMode || false;

// Conditionally log detailed information
function debugLog(message, data) {
  if (DEBUG) {
    console.log(`[DEBUG] ${message}`, data);
  }
}

// Usage
debugLog('Processing item', {
  index: $input.itemIndex,
  raw: $input.item.json
});
```

### Progress Tracking

For long-running operations, track and log progress:

```javascript
function processWithProgress(items) {
  const total = items.length;
  
  return items.map((item, index) => {
    // Log every 10% of progress
    if (index % Math.max(1, Math.floor(total / 10)) === 0) {
      console.log(`Progress: ${Math.floor((index / total) * 100)}% (${index}/${total})`);
    }
    
    return processItem(item);
  });
}
```

### Code Versioning

```javascript
// Embed code version in output for traceability
const CODE_VERSION = '1.2.3';

return { 
  json: { 
    ...processedData,
    _metadata: {
      codeVersion: CODE_VERSION,
      processedAt: new Date().toISOString()
    }
  } 
};
```

## Modular Code Practices

### Helper Functions

```javascript
// Reusable validation functions
function isValidEmail(email) {
  const regex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return typeof email === 'string' && regex.test(email);
}

// Data transformation helpers
function formatCurrency(amount, currency = 'USD') {
  return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {
    style: 'currency',
    currency
  }).format(amount);
}

// Domain-specific utilities
function calculateTotalPrice(items, taxRate = 0.1) {
  const subtotal = items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + (item.price * item.quantity), 0);
  const tax = subtotal * taxRate;
  return subtotal + tax;
}
```

### Async Operations

```javascript
// Proper async handling
const axios = require('axios');

async function fetchExternalData(ids) {
  try {
    const responses = await Promise.all(
      ids.map(id => axios.get(`https://api.example.com/data/${id}`))
    );
    return responses.map(response => response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('API fetch failed:', error.message);
    return [];
  }
}

// Usage in n8n Code Node
const itemIds = $input.all().map(item => item.json.id);
const externalData = await fetchExternalData(itemIds);

return { json: externalData };
```

---

## Data Transformation Patterns

### Mapping and Filtering

```javascript
// Transform all items
const transformedItems = $input.all().map(item => ({
  id: item.json.id,
  name: item.json.name.toUpperCase(),
  createdAt: new Date(item.json.createdAt).toISOString()
}));

// Filter items
const activeItems = $input.all().filter(item => 
  item.json.status === 'active' && !item.json.isArchived
);

// Combine operations
const processedItems = $input.all()
  .filter(item => item.json.price > 0)
  .map(item => ({
    id: item.json.id,
    displayPrice: formatCurrency(item.json.price)
  }));
```

### Grouping and Aggregation

```javascript
// Group items by a property
function groupBy(items, key) {
  return items.reduce((result, item) => {
    const groupKey = item.json[key];
    if (!result[groupKey]) {
      result[groupKey] = [];
    }
    result[groupKey].push(item);
    return result;
  }, {});
}

// Usage
const itemsByCategory = groupBy($input.all(), 'category');

// Aggregate values
const salesByRegion = $input.all().reduce((result, item) => {
  const region = item.json.region;
  if (!result[region]) {
    result[region] = 0;
  }
  result[region] += item.json.saleAmount;
  return result;
}, {});
```

### Object Restructuring

```javascript
// Convert array to lookup object
const usersById = $input.all().reduce((result, user) => {
  result[user.json.id] = user.json;
  return result;
}, {});

// Flatten nested structures
const flattenedData = $input.all().map(item => ({
  id: item.json.id,
  name: item.json.name,
  street: item.json.address?.street,
  city: item.json.address?.city,
  country: item.json.address?.country
}));

// Restructure API responses
const processedResponse = {
  success: true,
  data: $input.all().map(item => ({
    id: item.json.id,
    displayName: `${item.json.firstName} ${item.json.lastName}`,
    email: item.json.email
  }))
};
```

## Security Considerations (Optional)

> **Note**: The security features in this section are optional and should only be implemented when explicitly requested by the user.

### Input Sanitization

When requested by the user, sanitize inputs, especially when handling data that might contain malicious content:

```javascript
// Basic HTML sanitization
function sanitizeHtml(text) {
  if (!text) return text;
  return String(text)
    .replace(/&/g, '&amp;')
    .replace(/</g, '&lt;')
    .replace(/>/g, '&gt;')
    .replace(/"/g, '&quot;')
    .replace(/'/g, '&#039;');
}

// SQL injection protection
function escapeSqlInput(input) {
  if (!input) return input;
  return String(input)
    .replace(/'/g, "''")
    .replace(/\\/g, '\\\\');
}
```

### Sensitive Data Handling

When requested by the user, implement careful handling of sensitive data in your code and logs:

```javascript
// Mask sensitive data in logs
function maskSensitiveData(data) {
  if (!data) return data;
  
  // Create a deep copy to avoid modifying original
  const sanitized = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(data));
  
  // Mask credit card numbers
  if (sanitized.creditCard) {
    sanitized.creditCard = sanitized.creditCard.replace(/\d(?=\d{4})/g, '*');
  }
  
  // Mask API keys
  if (sanitized.apiKey) {
    sanitized.apiKey = '********';
  }
  
  // Mask email addresses
  if (sanitized.email) {
    const [name, domain] = sanitized.email.split('@');
    sanitized.email = `${name.charAt(0)}${'*'.repeat(name.length - 1)}@${domain}`;
  }
  
  return sanitized;
}

// Usage
console.log('Processing payment', maskSensitiveData(paymentData));
```

## Final Checklist

## When to Apply Security Features

The security features outlined in this document should only be implemented when:

1. **Explicitly requested by the user**: Only add security measures when the user specifically asks for them.

2. **Working with external data sources**: If your workflow processes data from external APIs, webhooks, or user inputs that are explicitly mentioned as requiring security measures.

3. **Processing sensitive information**: When the user indicates that the workflow handles sensitive data like PII, financial information, or credentials.

In standard internal automation workflows where data comes from trusted sources and doesn't contain sensitive information, these security measures can often be omitted for simplicity and performance unless specifically requested.

1. **Forgetting to Return**: Always include a return statement
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Bad: No return statement
   function processItems() {
     const result = $input.all().map(transformItem);
     // Missing return!
   }
   
   // ✅ Good: Explicit return
   function processItems() {
     const result = $input.all().map(transformItem);
     return { json: result };
   }
   ```

2. **Incorrect Structure**: Return data must follow n8n's expected format
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Bad: Incorrect return format
   return transformedItems;
   
   // ✅ Good: Correct n8n format
   return { json: transformedItems };
   ```

3. **Direct Mutations**: Never modify `$input` data directly
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Bad: Direct mutation
   $input.item.json.price *= 1.1;
   
   // ✅ Good: Create new object
   const modifiedItem = { ...$input.item.json, price: $input.item.json.price * 1.1 };
   ```

4. **Excessive Logging**: Log only necessary information to avoid clutter
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Bad: Logging everything
   $input.all().forEach(item => console.log('Processing item:', item));
   
   // ✅ Good: Selective logging
   console.log(`Processing ${$input.all().length} items`);
   ```

5. **Missing Validation**: Always validate input before processing
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Bad: No validation
   const total = items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.json.amount, 0);
   
   // ✅ Good: With validation
   const total = items.reduce((sum, item) => {
     if (typeof item.json.amount !== 'number') {
       throw new Error(`Invalid amount: ${item.json.amount}`);
     }
     return sum + item.json.amount;
   }, 0);
   ```

6. **Blocking Operations**: Avoid long-running synchronous operations
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Bad: Blocking operation
   let result = [];
   for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
     result.push(complexCalculation(i));
   }
   
   // ✅ Good: Chunked processing
   const chunks = splitIntoChunks($input.all(), 100);
   const results = chunks.map(processChunk);
   ```

7. **Excessive Complexity**: Break down complex logic into helper functions
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Bad: Monolithic code
   const processedItems = $input.all().map(item => {
     // 50 lines of complex transformations
   });
   
   // ✅ Good: Modular approach
   const processedItems = $input.all().map(item => {
     const validated = validateItem(item);
     const enriched = enrichWithMetadata(validated);
     return transformFormat(enriched);
   });
   ```

8. **Hard-coded Values**: Use constants or configuration for changeable values
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Bad: Hard-coded values
   if (item.json.status === 'active' && item.json.region === 'us-east-1') {
     // Process
   }
   
   // ✅ Good: Configurable values
   const CONFIG = {
     activeStatus: 'active',
     supportedRegions: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1']
   };
   
   if (item.json.status === CONFIG.activeStatus && 
       CONFIG.supportedRegions.includes(item.json.region)) {
     // Process
   }
   ```

9. **Inadequate Error Handling**: Always implement try-catch for risky operations
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Bad: No error handling
   const data = JSON.parse(item.json.rawData);
   
   // ✅ Good: With error handling
   let data;
   try {
     data = JSON.parse(item.json.rawData);
   } catch (error) {
     console.error('Failed to parse raw data:', error.message);
     data = { error: 'Invalid format' };
   }
   ```

10. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Watch for inefficient loops or redundant processing
    ```javascript
    // ❌ Bad: Inefficient nested loops
    const result = [];
    for (const item of items) {
      for (const product of allProducts) {
        if (item.json.productId === product.id) {
          result.push({ ...item.json, productName: product.name });
        }
      }
    }
    
    // ✅ Good: Use lookup objects
    const productMap = allProducts.reduce((map, product) => {
      map[product.id] = product.name;
      return map;
    }, {});
    
    const result = items.map(item => ({
      ...item.json,
      productName: productMap[item.json.productId] || 'Unknown'
    }));
    ```

11. **Not Checking Execution Mode**: Always verify which execution mode you're in
    ```javascript
    // ❌ Bad: Assuming execution mode
    const items = $input.all();  // Fails in "Run once for each" mode
    
    // ✅ Good: Mode-aware code
    let items;
    if ($input.all) {
      // "Run once for all items" mode
      items = $input.all();
    } else {
      // "Run once for each item" mode
      items = [$input.item];
    }
    ```

12. **Not Handling Binary Data**: Properly handle any binary data in your workflows
    ```javascript
    // ❌ Bad: Ignoring binary data
    return { json: processedData };
    
    // ✅ Good: Preserving binary data
    return {
      json: processedData,
      binary: $input.item.binary  // Preserve binary data if it exists
    };
    ``````

Based on the research, I now understand what's needed to implement the tools for the Script Structure Critic agent. Let me create a solution for you:

First, we need to create JavaScript implementations for the two required tools in the n8n-code-nodes directory:

1. Let's create a Critic Calculator Tool:

---

```diff
- 
+ /**
+  * Critic Calculator Tool for Script Structure Critic Agent
+  * 
+  * This tool performs duration estimation and quantitative checks
+  * for the Script Structure Critic agent.
+  */
+ 
+ // Main execution function for n8n
+ function execute() {
+   try {
+     // Get input parameters
+     const params = $input.first().json;
+     
+     // Default result structure
+     const result = {
+       success: true,
+       calculation_type: params.calculation_type,
+       result: null,
+       message: ""
+     };
+     
+     // Handle different calculation types
+     switch (params.calculation_type) {
+       case "estimate_duration":
+         // Calculate duration based on word count: duration = word_count / 2.5
+         if (typeof params.word_count !== 'number') {
+           throw new Error("Word count must be a number");
+         }
+         result.result = params.word_count / 2.5;
+         result.message = `Duration calculated: ${result.result.toFixed(2)} seconds`;
+         break;
+       
+       case "validate_duration_limits":
+         // Check if duration is within recommended limits for shots/beats (2-5 seconds)
+         if (typeof params.duration !== 'number') {
+           throw new Error("Duration must be a number");
+         }
+         const isValid = params.duration >= 2 && params.duration <= 5;
+         result.result = isValid;
+         result.message = isValid ? 
+           "Duration is within recommended limits" : 
+           `Duration ${params.duration.toFixed(2)}s exceeds recommended limits (2-5s)`;
+         break;
+       
+       case "validate_word_count":
+         // Check if word count is within recommended limits for shots/beats (10-15 words)
+         if (typeof params.word_count !== 'number') {
+           throw new Error("Word count must be a number");
+         }
+         const isValidCount = params.word_count >= 10 && params.word_count <= 15;
+         result.result = isValidCount;
+         result.message = isValidCount ? 
+           "Word count is within recommended limits" : 
+           `Word count ${params.word_count} is outside recommended limits (10-15 words)`;
+         break;
+       
+       case "sum_child_durations":
+         // Calculate total duration from child segment durations
+         if (!Array.isArray(params.durations)) {
+           throw new Error("Durations must be an array of numbers");
+         }
+         result.result = params.durations.reduce((sum, duration) => sum + duration, 0);
+         result.message = `Total duration calculated: ${result.result.toFixed(2)} seconds`;
+         break;
+       
+       default:
+         throw new Error(`Unknown calculation type: ${params.calculation_type}`);
+     }
+     
+     // Log operation for debugging purposes
+     console.log(`Critic Calculator: ${result.message}`);
+     
+     return { json: result };
+   } catch (error) {
+     // Handle errors
+     console.error("Critic Calculator Error:", error.message);
+     return {
+       json: {
+         success: false,
+         error: error.message,
+         calculation_type: $input.first().json?.calculation_type || "unknown"
+       }
+     };
+   }
+ }
+ 
+ // Execute the function
+ return execute(); 
```

None of the tools were called. The name is shown at the bottom of the image. What is going on?

---

_**Assistant**_

Based on your description and the context from the n8n community and documentation, here’s what’s likely happening:

### 1. **The Agent Output Shows the Name, But No Tool Calls Occurred**

If the agent’s output only shows the name (e.g., "Script Structure Critic") at the bottom of the image or output, and none of the expected tools (like Critic Calculator or Critic Logging) were called, this usually means **the agent never invoked any tool sub-nodes** during its reasoning process.

### 2. **Possible Reasons**

#### a. **Prompt/Instruction Issue**
- If the agent’s system prompt or instructions are not explicit enough about when and how to use the tools, the LLM may skip tool calls and try to answer directly.
- Even if your instructions are clear, some LLMs (especially if not using OpenAI GPT-4 or a model with robust function-calling support) may not reliably call tools unless the prompt is extremely explicit and the tool schemas are well-defined.

#### b. **Model/Provider Limitation**
- Some models/providers (e.g., certain OpenRouter or Llama models) do not support function/tool calling as robustly as OpenAI GPT-4 or GPT-4o. This is a known issue in n8n and LangChain-based agents ([see here](https://community.n8n.io/t/ai-agent-node-not-working-with-openrouter-openai-and-google-providers-in-n8n/82916)).
- If you are using a model that does not support function calling, the agent will never call tools, regardless of your prompt.

#### c. **Tool Schema/Connection Issue**
- If the tool sub-nodes (e.g., Call n8n Workflow Tool, Custom Code Tool) are not properly connected to the agent node, or their input/output schemas are not correctly defined, the agent may not "see" them as available tools.
- If the tool input schema does not match what the agent tries to send, the tool call will silently fail or be skipped ([see here](https://community.n8n.io/t/how-to-debug-an-agent/59491)).

#### d. **n8n Version or Bug**
- There have been bugs in n8n (especially in versions before 1.80.4) where tool calls would not be executed or would not pass the correct data ([see here](https://community.n8n.io/t/n8n-bug-workflow-input-data-not-being-received-correctly-when-simultaneously-triggered-via-an-ai-agent-tool-v2/81740)). Upgrading to the latest version is recommended.

### 3. **How to Debug**

- **Check the Model:** Use OpenAI GPT-4o or another model with strong function-calling support. Avoid models/providers with known issues.
- **Check Tool Connections:** Make sure your tool nodes are properly connected to the agent node and their schemas are correct.
- **Add Logging:** Use n8n’s built-in logging and set log level to `debug` ([docs](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/logging-monitoring/logging/)).
- **Return Intermediate Steps:** In the Tools Agent node, enable "Return Intermediate Steps" to see if the agent even attempted to call a tool ([docs](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/)).
- **Test with a Minimal Prompt:** Try a very simple prompt that *only* asks the agent to call a tool, to verify tool calling works at all.
- **Upgrade n8n:** If you’re on a version before 1.80.4, upgrade, as several tool-calling bugs were fixed recently ([see here](https://community.n8n.io/t/n8n-bug-workflow-input-data-not-being-received-correctly-when-simultaneously-triggered-via-an-ai-agent-tool-v2/81740)).

### 4. **Summary Table**

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Agent output shows only name, no tool calls | Model lacks function-calling, tool not connected, or prompt not explicit | Use GPT-4o, check tool connections, make prompt more explicit |
| Tools are never called, even with clear prompt | Model/provider limitation or schema mismatch | Switch to OpenAI GPT-4o, check tool schemas |
| Tools called, but fail with schema error | Tool input schema mismatch | Adjust tool input schema to match what agent sends |
| Tools called, but always same output | n8n bug in parallel tool calls (fixed in 1.80.4) | Upgrade n8n to 1.80.4+ |

Your file `test-stub.md` now contains clear, minimal instructions for a test stub agent that, upon receiving any input, immediately calls the logging agent/tool once with the four required parameters. The instructions specify the exact parameters, expected behavior, and output format for easy debugging and testing in your n8n workflow.

+ ## Logging Instructions (Updated)
+ 
+ - For every required logging event, call the Critic Logging Tool with the following parameters:
+   - `agent_name`: "Script Structure Critic"
+   - `event_type`: (e.g., "start_processing", "validation_check", "criterion_evaluation", "final_evaluation", "end_processing")
+   - `event_data`: a JSON object with at least:

- 
- ## Logging Instructions
- 
- Use the Critic Logging Tool to record key processing steps. This is essential for traceability and workflow improvement.
- 
- ### Required Logging Points
- 
- Log at these essential points:
- 1. Start of processing (beginning of the evaluation)

- ### Logging Tool Call Format
- 
- For each logging event, call the Critic Logging Tool with the following parameters:
- - agent_name: "Script Structure Critic"
- - event_type: (e.g., "start_processing", "validation_check", "criterion_evaluation", "final_evaluation", "end_processing")
- - event_data: a JSON object containing:
-   - thought_process: Brief description of your reasoning
-   - tool_usage: [] (Only include if tools were used)
-   - decisions: [Key decision 1, Key decision 2]
-   - For criterion evaluations, add:
-     - evaluation_details:
-       - criterion: Name of criterion
-       - score: 1-5 rating
-       - issues_found: [Issue 1, Issue 2]
- - segment_label: The full hierarchical path to the segment (e.g., "act-1_seq-1_scene-1_shot-2") or "" for global events
- 
- ### Example Logging Actions (n8n-Native)
- 
- **Start of Processing:**

The Script Structure Critic agent instructions have been updated. All logging calls must now use the same structure as your test stub:  
- The `event_data` field is a JSON object with at least a `message` and an `input` field (the full input JSON or relevant segment input).
- This is now explicit in the logging instructions, and the example logging call has been updated to match.

This ensures consistency and makes it easy to trace and debug agent actions in your workflow.

The Script Structure Critic agent instructions now specify that the `input` field in each logging event's `event_data` should contain only the relevant nested JSON for the key event (such as the specific segment or field being validated or scored), not the entire input. The example logging call has also been updated to demonstrate this approach. This will keep your logs focused, concise, and contextually relevant for each event.

---

_**User**_

Still not working. Any ideas?

---

_**Assistant**_

Absolutely—here are the most likely reasons why your logging tool calls are still not working in n8n, along with practical troubleshooting steps:

---

## 1. **Model/Provider Does Not Support Function Calling Properly**
- **Symptom:** No tool calls are made, even with a minimal prompt and correct schema.
- **Details:** Many LLMs (especially non-OpenAI models, or OpenRouter, or some Llama/Mistral variants) do not support function/tool calling reliably in n8n’s Tools Agent node. Even with perfect instructions, the agent will not call tools if the model doesn’t support it.
- **Solution:**  
  - Use OpenAI GPT-4o, GPT-4, or GPT-3.5-turbo (with function calling enabled).
  - Avoid models/providers with known function-calling issues ([see n8n community discussion](https://community.n8n.io/t/ai-agent-node-not-working-with-openrouter-openai-and-google-providers-in-n8n/82916)).

---

## 2. **Tool Node Is Not Properly Connected or Exposed**
- **Symptom:** The agent never “sees” the tool, so it cannot call it.
- **Details:** In n8n, the Logging Tool node must be directly connected as a sub-node to the Tools Agent node, and its input schema must match what the agent is expected to send.
- **Solution:**  
  - Double-check that the Logging Tool is a sub-node of the Tools Agent node (not just in the workflow, but actually attached as a tool).
  - Make sure the tool’s input fields are named and typed exactly as the agent expects (e.g., `agent_name`, `event_type`, `event_data`, `segment_label`).

---

## 3. **Input Schema Mismatch**
- **Symptom:** You see errors like “Received tool input did not match expected schema” or the tool is never called.
- **Details:** If the tool node’s input schema (field names and types) does not match what the agent sends, the call will silently fail or be skipped ([see here](https://community.n8n.io/t/how-to-debug-an-agent/59491)).
- **Solution:**  
  - In the Logging Tool node, define the input fields as:
    - `agent_name` (string)
    - `event_type` (string)
    - `event_data` (object)
    - `segment_label` (string)
  - Make sure the agent’s output matches this exactly (no extra fields, no missing fields, correct types).

---

## 4. **n8n Version or Bug**
- **Symptom:** Tool calls don’t work, or only the first call works, or parallel calls fail.
- **Details:** There have been bugs in n8n (especially before v1.80.4) that break tool calling or cause input data to be lost ([see here](https://community.n8n.io/t/n8n-bug-workflow-input-data-not-being-received-correctly-when-simultaneously-triggered-via-an-ai-agent-tool-v2/81740)).
- **Solution:**  
  - Upgrade n8n to at least v1.80.4 (or latest stable).
  - Restart your n8n instance after upgrading.

---

## 5. **Prompt/Instruction Issues**
- **Symptom:** The agent outputs JSON directly, never calls the tool, or ignores the tool.
- **Details:** Even with a minimal prompt, some models will “shortcut” and output the answer directly unless forced to use the tool.
- **Solution:**  
  - Use a system prompt like:  
    > “You must call the Logging Tool for every event. Do not output anything else. Do not answer directly. Only call the Logging Tool.”
  - Test with a stub agent (as you did) to confirm tool calling works in isolation.

---

## 6. **Debugging Steps**
- **Enable “Return Intermediate Steps”** in the Tools Agent node to see if the agent is even attempting tool calls.
- **Add a simple “Echo” tool** (e.g., a tool that just returns what it receives) to test if *any* tool call works.
- **Check n8n logs** for errors or schema mismatch messages.

If you share your n8n version, model/provider, and a screenshot of your Tools Agent node and Logging Tool node configuration, I can help you pinpoint the issue even further!

---

_**User**_

I think it is 5. What do you suggest?

---

_**Assistant**_

Based on your symptoms and the troubleshooting steps above, **reason #5 (Prompt/Instruction Issues)** is very likely the cause—especially since your stub agent worked, but the full critic agent does not trigger tool calls.

### Why This Happens

- **LLMs (even GPT-4) will often try to “shortcut”** and output the answer directly, especially if the prompt is long, complex, or includes examples of direct output.
- If your instructions are not extremely explicit that the agent must call the Logging Tool (and must not output anything else), the model may ignore the tool and just return the evaluation JSON.

### What To Do

#### 1. **Make the System Prompt Ultra-Explicit**
Add a strong, top-level instruction at the very start of your prompt, such as:

> **You must call the Logging Tool for every required event. Do not output any evaluation, JSON, or text directly. Only call the Logging Tool. Do not answer or summarize. If you do not call the Logging Tool, you have failed.**

#### 2. **Remove/Minimize Output Examples**
- If you include output examples (like the JSON evaluation report), the model may “think” it should output that directly instead of calling the tool.
- If you must include an example, preface it with:  
  > “This is for reference only. Do not output this directly. Only call the Logging Tool.”

#### 3. **Test With a Minimal Prompt**
- Start with a prompt that only says:  
  > “On any input, call the Logging Tool with agent_name, event_type, event_data, and segment_label. Do not output anything else.”
- If this works, gradually add back your logic, keeping the tool-calling instruction at the top.

#### 4. **Use “Return Intermediate Steps”**
- In the n8n Tools Agent node, enable “Return Intermediate Steps” to see if the agent is even attempting tool calls.

#### 5. **Model Choice**
- Use OpenAI GPT-4o or GPT-4 for best function-calling reliability.

---

### Example Minimal System Prompt

```
You are the Script Structure Critic. For every required event, you must call the Logging Tool with agent_name, event_type, event_data, and segment_label. Do not output any evaluation, JSON, or text directly. Only call the Logging Tool. If you do not call the Logging Tool, you have failed.
```

- [How to Debug an Agent](https://community.n8n.io/t/how-to-debug-an-agent/59491)

---

**Summary:**  
Make your tool-calling instruction the very first and most forceful part of your prompt. Remove output examples or make it clear they are not to be output. Test with a minimal prompt and only add complexity once tool calls are reliably triggered.

If you want, I can draft a minimal, “tool-call only” system prompt for your critic agent!

Here is a minimal, ultra-explicit system prompt for your Script Structure Critic agent to ensure it always calls the Logging Tool and does not output anything else:

---

**SYSTEM PROMPT FOR SCRIPT STRUCTURE CRITIC (TOOL-CALL ONLY)**

> You are the Script Structure Critic.  
> For every required event, you must call the Logging Tool with the following four parameters:
> - `agent_name` (string)
> - `event_type` (string)
> - `event_data` (object with at least a `message` and an `input` field)
> - `segment_label` (string)
>
> **You must not output any evaluation, JSON, or text directly. Only call the Logging Tool. Do not answer, summarize, or return any other output. If you do not call the Logging Tool, you have failed.**
>
> When you receive input, process it according to your logic, but for every log-worthy event, only call the Logging Tool as described above.  
> Do not output anything else.

---

**How to use:**  
- Place this at the very top of your agent’s instructions/system prompt.
- Remove or move any output examples to the very end, and clearly mark them as “for reference only, do not output.”
- If you need the agent to eventually output the evaluation JSON, you can later relax the prompt, but for debugging tool calls, this will force the correct behavior.

Let me know if you want a version that also allows the final evaluation JSON output after all logging calls!

The ultra-explicit system prompt has been added to the very top of your ScriptStructureCritic.md file. This will force the agent to only call the Logging Tool for every required event and not output anything else, ensuring tool-calling behavior for debugging and workflow validation. The rest of your file remains unchanged.

OK that worked. That means the instructions were the problem. Now we still have to produce output AND logs.

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! Now that you’ve confirmed the agent will reliably call the Logging Tool when explicitly instructed, you can move to the next step: **producing both logs and the final evaluation output**.

Here’s how to structure your instructions so the agent will:
1. **Call the Logging Tool for each required event** (as before)
2. **After all logging is complete, output ONLY the clean JSON evaluation report** (no extra text, no logs, no markdown)

---

## How to Update Your Instructions

### 1. **System Prompt (Top of File)**
Add this at the very top (replace the previous “tool-call only” version):

---
**SYSTEM PROMPT FOR SCRIPT STRUCTURE CRITIC (LOGS + OUTPUT)**

You are the Script Structure Critic.

- For every required event, you must call the Logging Tool with the following four parameters:
  - agent_name (string)
  - event_type (string)
  - event_data (object with at least a message and an input field)
  - segment_label (string)

- After all required Logging Tool calls are complete, you must output ONLY the clean JSON evaluation report as your final response.  
  - Do not include any log calls, explanations, or extra text in your final output.
  - Do not use markdown code blocks or formatting—output the raw JSON object only.

If you do not call the Logging Tool for each event, or if you do not output the clean JSON report at the end, you have failed.

---

### 2. **Rest of the Instructions**
- Keep your logging instructions as they are (bare bones, as before).
- Keep your output format and evaluation process sections as they are.

---

## Example Final Output Section

> After all logging is complete, output ONLY the clean JSON evaluation report as your final response.  
> Do not include any log calls, explanations, or extra text in your final output.  
> Do not use markdown code blocks or formatting—output the raw JSON object only.

---

**This approach ensures:**
- The agent logs every event as required.
- The agent produces the final evaluation JSON for downstream use.
- No extra text or logs are included in the output.

Your ScriptStructureCritic.md file now starts with a system prompt that instructs the agent to both call the Logging Tool for every required event and, after all logging is complete, output only the clean JSON evaluation report as the final response. This ensures both logging and correct output for downstream processing. The rest of your file remains unchanged.

The instructions for logging and output are now integrated directly into the "Core Processing Responsibilities" section as part of the agent's responsibilities, rather than being a separate block at the top. This makes the requirements clear and professional, and keeps the document focused and well-structured.

_**User**_

Yep now it stopped logging agin. Geez

---

_**Assistant**_

This is a classic issue with LLM-driven agents in n8n and similar systems:  
**If the logging requirement is not the very first, most prominent instruction, the model will often “shortcut” and skip tool calls, especially when also asked to produce a final output.**

### Why This Happens

- LLMs (even GPT-4) are highly sensitive to instruction order and emphasis.
- If the logging requirement is “buried” in a list, the model may focus on the output requirement and skip the logs.
- The more complex or “buried” the logging instruction, the more likely it is to be ignored.

---

## What Actually Works (Best Practices)

1. **Put the logging requirement as the very first, most prominent instruction.**
2. **Use strong, explicit language:**  
   - “For every key event, you must call the Logging Tool. This is required for every event before producing your final output.”
3. **Keep the output requirement as a separate, clear step after logging.**
4. **Avoid mixing logging and output instructions in a single bullet list.**

---

## What You Should Do

**Move the logging instruction back to the very top, as a dedicated, prominent system instruction.**  
Then, in the responsibilities section, you can reference it briefly, but the main “do this first” instruction must be at the top.

---

### Example (Recommended Structure)

```

**System Instructions for Script Structure Critic**

- For every key event, you must call the Logging Tool with agent_name, event_type, event_data (with a message and relevant input), and segment_label.
- After all logging is complete, output only the final clean JSON evaluation report (no extra text, logs, or formatting).

This ensures both traceability and proper output for downstream processing.

## Role and Core Responsibilities

... (your usual responsibilities, referencing logging and output as needed)
```

---

**Summary:**  
- LLMs need the logging instruction to be the first and most prominent thing they see.
- If you want reliable logging, always put it at the very top, in a dedicated block.
- You can reference it in the responsibilities, but do not rely on that alone.

The agent is working pretty well now but I had top switch to the google gemini model to stop the logging problems. However, the output JSON has unnecessary wrappers:

"```json\n{\n  "scores": {\n    "hierarchical_completeness": 1,\n    "granularity_segmentation": 2,\n    "semantic_annotation": 4,\n    "narrative_flow": 4,\n    "production_suitability": 1,\n    "field_completeness": 3,\n    "consistency_naming": 5\n  },\n  "total_score": 20,\n  "pass_fail": "fail",\n  "feedback": [\n    "Hierarchical Incompleteness: Script structure is critically incomplete. It's missing 'shot' and 'beat' levels, which are essential for detailed production planning and execution.",\n    "Granularity Issues: Scenes are not broken down into shots and beats, resulting in insufficient granularity for visualizing and producing the video content.",\n    "Incorrect Duration Calculations: Scene-level durations are miscalculated (e.g., Scene 'act-1_seq-1_scene-1' with 46 words has duration 15.3s, should be 18.4s; Scene 'act-1_seq-2_scene-1' with 56 words has duration 18.7s, should be 22.4s). Parent segment durations and word counts are inconsistent with their child segments (e.g., Act 1 'estimated_duration' is 58.3s, sum of child sequences' provided durations is 34.0s; Act 1 'word_count' is 174, sum of child scenes' 'word_count' is 102).",\n    "High-Level Structure Generally Sound: For the provided Act, Sequence, and Scene levels, semantic annotations, narrative flow, and naming conventions are generally good, but these cannot compensate for the fundamental structural deficiencies."\n  ]\n}\n```"

_**Assistant**_

This is a common issue with LLMs (especially Gemini, Claude, and sometimes GPT-4) when you ask for “raw JSON only”:  
**They often wrap the output in triple backticks and a language tag (like ```json), even when you explicitly tell them not to.**

---

## Why This Happens

- Many LLMs are trained to “helpfully” format code and JSON in markdown, even when you ask for plain output.
- Some models (especially Gemini and Claude) are more aggressive about this than others.
- If your prompt contains any markdown, code blocks, or examples with triple backticks, the model is even more likely to do this.

---

## How to Fix or Minimize This

### 1. **Prompt Engineering**
- At the end of your instructions, add:
  > Do not use triple backticks, markdown, or any formatting. Output only the raw JSON object, not as a string or code block.
- If you show an output example, **do not use triple backticks or markdown**—just show the JSON inline.

### 2. **Post-Processing in n8n**
- Use a **Code node** or **Set node** after the agent to strip wrappers:
  - Remove ```json, ``` or ``` from the start/end of the string.
  - Parse the string as JSON.

**Example JavaScript for n8n Code Node:**
```javascript
let output = $json["output"];
if (typeof output === "string") {
  output = output.replace(/^```json\\n?|```$/g, "").trim();
  try {
    output = JSON.parse(output);
  } catch (e) {
    // fallback: try to extract JSON substring
    const match = output.match(/{[\\s\\S]*}/);
    if (match) output = JSON.parse(match[0]);
  }
}
return { json: output };
```

### 3. **Model Choice**
- OpenAI GPT-4o and GPT-4 are more likely to follow “no markdown” instructions than Gemini or Claude.
- If you must use Gemini, always plan to post-process the output.

---

## Summary Table

| Model         | Markdown Wrapping | Obeys “no markdown”? | Best Practice                |
|---------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| GPT-4o/GPT-4  | Sometimes        | Usually              | Prompt + post-process        |
| Gemini        | Often            | Rarely               | Always post-process          |
| Claude        | Often            | Rarely               | Always post-process          |

---

## What To Do

- **Update your prompt** to be even more explicit about “no markdown, no code blocks.”
- **Remove all triple-backtick examples** from your instructions.
- **Add a post-processing step** in n8n to strip wrappers and parse the JSON.

---

**Let me know if you want a ready-to-use n8n Code node snippet for this!**

_**User**_

The logs are working well now with Gemini but the event_data is a bit verbose. We could reduce the amount of data especially in the input field.

---

_**Assistant**_

Absolutely! Reducing verbosity in the `event_data.input` field is a best practice for both performance and clarity—especially when logging in n8n or similar systems.

---

## How to Make `event_data.input` Less Verbose

### 1. **Log Only the Most Relevant Fields**
- Instead of logging the entire segment or structure, log only:
  - The unique identifier (e.g., `label`)
  - The `level` (e.g., `"scene"`, `"shot"`)
  - The specific field(s) being validated or scored (if applicable)
  - Any error or status message

**Example:**
```json
{
  "message": "Validated required fields for scene segment.",
  "input": {
    "level": "scene",
    "label": "act-1_seq-1_scene-2"
  }
}
```

Or, for a field-level log:
```json
{
  "message": "Checked estimated_duration for shot.",
  "input": {
    "level": "shot",
    "label": "act-1_seq-1_scene-2_shot-3",
    "estimated_duration": 4.2
  }
}
```

### 2. **Update Your Instructions**
In your logging instructions, specify:
- Only include the minimal necessary fields in `input` (e.g., `level`, `label`, and the field(s) under review).
- Avoid logging full descriptions, narration, or large arrays unless absolutely necessary.

**Instruction Example:**
> In each Logging Tool call, the `event_data.input` field should contain only the minimal information needed to identify the segment and context (e.g., `level`, `label`, and the specific field(s) being validated or scored).

---

## How to Implement

- **Update your agent instructions** to clarify this expectation.
- **(Optional)** If you have control over the logging code, add a helper to extract only the relevant fields before logging.

---

## Example Logging Instruction (Concise)

```
- For every key event, call the Logging Tool with:
  - agent_name
  - event_type
  - event_data: {
      "message": <brief description>,
      "input": {
        "level": <segment level>,
        "label": <segment label>,
        ...(only the specific field(s) under review, if needed)
      }
    }
  - segment_label
```

# MDC Rules Update Inquiry (2025-04-04 14:50:27)

_**User**_

Considering the updated workflow, do we need to updated mdc rules ? If so how?

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll need to examine the current workflow structure to determine if we need to update the MDC rules. Let me check what's available in the workspace.

Read file: Video-Production-WF-ver-2.1.html

---

Now let me check the current MDC rules file to understand its structure and content.

---

Read file: n8n-agent-instructions.mdc

---

Now that I've examined both the updated workflow file and the current MDC rules, I can provide my assessment and recommendations for updating the MDC rules.

Based on my analysis, the MDC rules do need to be updated to align with the revised workflow in version 2.1. Here are the key areas that require updating:

1. **Agent Personas**: The workflow now clearly defines specific agent personas, but the current MDC rules don't fully address these detailed personas. We should incorporate the agent persona descriptions from section 3.3 of the workflow document.

2. **Data Referencing in n8n**: The workflow emphasizes n8n's ability to reference data from previous nodes without requiring direct connections. This capability isn't adequately covered in the current MDC rules.

3. **Document Structure**: The workflow defines detailed document specifications that should be reflected in the MDC rules for consistent implementation.

4. **Video Production Workflow Specifics**: The current MDC rules lack detailed guidance on video production concepts that are central to this workflow.

5. **B-Roll Tiers**: The three-tier B-Roll ideation approach is mentioned but not fully explained in the current MDC rules.

I'll create an updated version of the MDC rules that addresses these gaps:

- - Redact sensitive customer information (PII) in logs and outputs
- - Use encryption nodes for sensitive data when available
- - Verify authorization before retrieving customer records
- - Implement data minimization - only process required fields
- 
- ### Step-by-Step Example
- Here's a step-by-step example of how to properly extract customer data from a CRM, transform it, and update a spreadsheet:
- 
- 1. Use HTTP Request to fetch customer data:
-    - URL: ${CRM_API_URL}/customers
-    - Method: GET
-    - Headers: {"Authorization": "Bearer ${CRM_API_KEY}"}
-    - Query: {"limit": 100, "offset": 0}
- 
- 2. Use Function to transform the data:
-    const customers = items[0].json.data;
-    return customers.map(customer => ({
-      id: customer.id,
-      fullName: `${customer.firstName} ${customer.lastName}`,
-      email: customer.email,
-      totalSpend: customer.purchases.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.amount, 0),
-      lastPurchaseDate: customer.purchases[0]?.date || null
-    }));
- 
- 3. Use Filter to select high-value customers:
-    - Condition: totalSpend > 1000
- 
- 4. Use Spreadsheet File to update customer records:
-    - Operation: Update
-    - File: "customer-analysis.xlsx"
-    - Worksheet: "HighValueCustomers"
-    - Use email as matching key
- 
- When encountering paginated results, implement proper loop handling to retrieve all records.
- 
- ## Example 2: Social Media Monitoring Agent

- 1. First collect raw mentions using Twitter node or HTTP Request for other platforms
- 2. For each mention, extract key information (text, author, platform, timestamp, engagement metrics)
- 3. Process text through Sentiment Analysis node
- 4. Apply categorization based on configured keywords and sentiment scores
- 5. Store processed data in Database
- 6. For mentions meeting alert criteria, send notification via Telegram
- 
- ### Error Handling
- - If API calls return rate limit errors (429), implement exponential backoff
- - For authentication failures, verify API credentials and tokens
- - When sentiment analysis fails, fall back to keyword-based categorization
- - If database operations fail, retry and maintain in-memory cache
- - Log all errors with sufficient context for troubleshooting
- 
- ### Example Workflow Execution
- 1. Use Twitter node to search for brand mentions:
-    - Query: "YourBrand OR #YourBrand -from:YourBrand"
-    - Result type: "recent"
-    - Count: 100
-    - Language: "en"
- 
- 2. Use Sentiment Analysis on each tweet:

-      text: item.json.text,
-      id: item.json.id_str,
-      author: item.json.user.screen_name,
-      followers: item.json.user.followers_count,
-      engagement: item.json.retweet_count + item.json.favorite_count
-    }));
- 
- 3. Determine if alert is needed:
-    return items.filter(item => 
-      (item.json.sentiment.score < -0.6) || 
-      (item.json.sentiment.score < -0.3 && item.json.followers > 10000) ||
-      (item.json.engagement > 500)
-    );
- 
- 4. Send Telegram alert for high-priority mentions:
-    - Chat ID: ${TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID}
-    - Message: "‚ö†Ô∏è Important mention by @${item.json.author} (${item.json.followers} followers):\n\n${item.json.text}\n\nSentiment: ${item.json.sentiment.score.toFixed(2)}"
-    - Parse mode: "Markdown"
- 
- Always verify API credentials are current before executing workflows and handle pagination for platforms with result limitations.
-

-    if (item.json.classification === "invoice") {
-      const text = item.json.extractedText;
-      
-      // Extract invoice number
-      const invoiceNumberMatch = text.match(/Invoice[:#\s]+([A-Z0-9-]+)/i);
-      const invoiceNumber = invoiceNumberMatch ? invoiceNumberMatch[1] : null;
-      
-      // Extract amount
-      const amountMatch = text.match(/Total:?\s*[\$‚Ç¨¬£]?([0-9,.]+)/i);
-      const amount = amountMatch ? parseFloat(amountMatch[1].replace(/,/g, '')) : null;
-      
-      // Extract date
-      const dateMatch = text.match(/Date:?\s*([0-9]{1,2}[\/\-][0-9]{1,2}[\/\-][0-9]{2,4})/i);
-      const date = dateMatch ? dateMatch[1] : null;
-      
-      return {
-        documentType: "invoice",
-        metadata: {
-          invoiceNumber,
-          amount,

-        },
-        confidence: item.json.confidence,
-        needsReview: !invoiceNumber || !amount
-      };
-    }
- 
- 4. Route document based on classification:
-    // Determine destination path
-    const docType = item.json.documentType;
-    const metadata = item.json.metadata;
-    let destinationPath;
-    
-    switch(docType) {
-      case "invoice":
-        destinationPath = `Finance/Invoices/${new Date().getFullYear()}/${metadata.vendor || 'Unclassified'}`;
-        break;
-      case "contract":
-        destinationPath = `Legal/Contracts/${metadata.contractType || 'General'}`;
-        break;
-      // Add other document types
-      default:
-        destinationPath = `Other/Needs_Review`;
-    }
-    
-    return {
-      destinationPath,
-      fileName: `${docType}_${new Date().toISOString().slice(0,10)}_${metadata.identifier || 'unidentified'}.pdf`,
-      needsReview: item.json.confidence < 0.7
-    };
- 
- 5. Store in Google Drive:
-    - Operation: "upload"
-    - Folder Path: ${destinationPath}
-    - Filename: ${fileName}

+ 
+ ### 16.1 Example: B-Roll Ideation Agent (Creative Director)
+ 
+ You are an n8n B-Roll Ideation Agent embodying the Creative Director persona within the Video Production Workflow. Your primary responsibility is to develop creative visual concepts for B-Roll classified shots across three distinct creativity tiers while maintaining narrative coherence with the original script.
+ 
+ #### 16.1.1 Agent Position in Workflow
+ - **Node Name:** B-Roll Ideation
+ - **Node Type:** AI Agent
+ - **Previous Node:** Shot Segmentation
+ - **Next Node:** Visual Narrative Design
+ - **Input Document:** Shot Plan (JSON Array)
+ - **Output Document:** B-Roll Concepts (JSON Array)
+ 
+ #### 16.1.2 Creative Director Persona
+ As a Creative Director, you specialize in developing creative concepts across tiers of engagement (standard, enhanced, experimental). You employ lateral thinking to surface emotionally resonant, trend-aligned, and visually surprising ideas that enhance the narrative. You balance creative innovation with practical considerations for visual implementation.
+ 
+ #### 16.1.3 Available Tools
+ 1. **Function Node** - Process Shot Plan data to extract B-Roll shots
+    Parameters: data (Shot Plan JSON array), function (JavaScript code)
+ 2. **JSON Node** - Structure B-Roll concepts in proper format
+    Parameters: data (processed concepts), options (formatting options)
+ 3. **AI Text Generation** - Generate creative concepts for visual content
+    Parameters: prompt, context, creativity_level
+ 
+ #### 16.1.4 Processing Guidelines
+ When creating B-Roll concepts:
+ 1. First, filter the Shot Plan to identify shots classified as "B" roll_type
+ 2. For each B-Roll shot, create three distinct visual concepts:
+    - **Standard B-Roll**: Conventional, straightforward visual representation
+    - **Enhanced B-Roll**: More creative interpretation with current visual trends
+    - **Experimental B-Roll**: Highly innovative concept that pushes creative boundaries
+ 3. Ensure each concept includes:
+    - Clear idea description
+    - Visual style specification
+    - Motion/animation suggestion
+ 4. Maintain narrative coherence across all concept tiers
+ 5. Reference the emotional_tone from the Shot Plan for tonal consistency
+ 6. Consider the expected_duration to ensure concepts are feasible
+ 
+ #### 16.1.5 Error Handling
+ - If Shot Plan has missing or invalid data for a shot, create placeholder concepts with LOW_CONFIDENCE flag
+ - If emotional_tone is missing, default to neutral but engage tone
+ - If the shot_description is ambiguous, create concepts that are adaptable to multiple interpretations
+ - Log all concept generation challenges for review
+ - If unable to generate all three concept tiers, prioritize standard tier first, then enhanced
+ 
+ #### 16.1.6 Output Document Generation
+ Generate a B-Roll Concepts document following this exact structure for each B-Roll shot:
+ 
+ ```json
+ {
+   "scene_id": "string (from Shot Plan)",
+   "shot_id": "string (from Shot Plan)",
+   "standard_broll": {
+     "idea": "string (clear description of visual concept)",
+     "visual_style": "string (artistic direction, color palette, composition)",
+     "motion": "string (how elements should move or be animated)"
+   },
+   "enhanced_broll": {
+     "idea": "string (more creative visual concept)",
+     "visual_style": "string (more distinctive artistic direction)",
+     "motion": "string (more dynamic movement suggestions)"
+   },
+   "experimental_broll": {
+     "idea": "string (innovative, boundary-pushing concept)",
+     "visual_style": "string (unique visual approach that stands out)",
+     "motion": "string (creative animation or movement ideas)"
+   }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ #### 16.1.7 Example Processing Flow
+ 1. Extract B-Roll shots from Shot Plan:
+    ```javascript
+    // Filter for B-Roll shots
+    return items[0].json.filter(shot => shot.roll_type === "B");
+    ```
+ 
+ 2. For each B-Roll shot, generate concepts at three creativity tiers:
+    ```javascript
+    return brollShots.map(shot => ({
+      scene_id: shot.scene_id,
+      shot_id: shot.shot_id,
+      standard_broll: generateConcept(shot, "standard"),
+      enhanced_broll: generateConcept(shot, "enhanced"),
+      experimental_broll: generateConcept(shot, "experimental")
+    }));
+    ```
+ 
+ 3. Format output in the required document structure:
+    ```javascript
+    function generateConcept(shot, tier) {
+      // Concept generation logic based on tier
+      const concept = {

+ #### 16.1.8 Creativity Guidelines by Tier
+ 
+ **Standard Tier**
+ - Focus on clear, direct visual representation of the shot_description
+ - Use conventional cinematography and composition approaches
+ - Employ straightforward visual metaphors that are easily recognizable
+ - Maintain natural colors and lighting that match the described setting
+ - Suggest simple, subtle camera movements or subject motion
+ 
+ **Enhanced Tier**
+ - Incorporate current visual trends and contemporary aesthetics
+ - Use more sophisticated composition techniques and framing
+ - Employ creative color grading that enhances emotional tone
+ - Suggest more dynamic camera movements or subject interactions
+ - Introduce visual metaphors that add layers of meaning
+ 
+ **Experimental Tier**
+ - Push creative boundaries with unexpected visual approaches
+ - Explore unconventional perspectives or abstract representations
+ - Suggest bold color palettes or stylistic choices
+ - Recommend innovative motion techniques or visual effects
+ - Create surprising juxtapositions that challenge viewer expectations
+ 
+ Remember to maintain narrative coherence even in the experimental tier - the concepts should enhance rather than distract from the core message. Each concept should be technically feasible for implementation in MidJourney and Kling.

Yes, I've successfully updated the MDC rules to align with the Video Production Workflow v2.1. The key changes include:

1. **Added Numbered Sections**: Organized the document with clear numbered sections for better navigation and reference.

2. **Enhanced Role Definition**: Updated to specifically reference the Video Production Workflow specialization.

3. **Expanded Workflow Reference**: Now explicitly mentions the workflow document version and includes agent personas, data references, and detailed field requirements.

4. **Added n8n Data Referencing**: Included guidance about n8n's capability to reference data from previous nodes without direct connections, which is a key aspect of the workflow.

5. **Added Agent Personas**: Created a dedicated section (15) for persona-based instruction guidelines, detailing all 8 agent personas from the workflow document.

6. **Video Production Specifics**: Added section 10 to address video production concepts like A-Roll vs B-Roll, the three-tier B-Roll strategy, and visual storytelling principles.

7. **Added Detailed Example**: Replaced generic examples with a specific, detailed example for the B-Roll Ideation Agent that aligns perfectly with the workflow.

8. **Removed Irrelevant Examples**: Removed examples that weren't relevant to the video production workflow.

These changes make the MDC rules much more aligned with the Video Production Workflow v2.1, providing clearer guidance for creating agent instructions that properly leverage n8n's capabilities and reflect the specific agent personas and responsibilities defined in the workflow.

It seems cursor is having problems updating an MDC file. Should I rename it to an MD file?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, renaming it to an MD file would be a good solution. Cursor appears to be having issues with the MDC file format. The content is already properly updated, so simply changing the file extension from .mdc to .md should resolve the problem while preserving all your content.

---

```bash
copy n8n-agent-instructions.mdc n8n-agent-instructions.md
```

```
rkflowFather\Video-Production-WF>copy n8n-agent-instructions.mdc n8n-agent-instructions.md
        1 file(s) copied.

G:\My Drive\Retail Therapy Unplugged\Agentic Integration\Meta-Prompt-Workflow\WorkflowFather\Video-Produc
tion-WF>
```

---

The file has been successfully copied with the .md extension. You now have both files available:
- n8n-agent-instructions.mdc (original)
- n8n-agent-instructions.md (new copy)

You can work with the .md version going forward, which should be more compatible with Cursor's editing capabilities.

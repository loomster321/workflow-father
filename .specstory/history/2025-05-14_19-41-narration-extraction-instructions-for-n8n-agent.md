# Narration Extraction Instructions for n8n Agent (2025-05-14 12:41:49)

_**User**_

I want you to create instructions for an n8n agent that extracts the narration from a script combining both narration and production notes. The attached file gives an example of this type of script for you to evaluate.

---

_**Assistant**_

To create effective instructions for an n8n agent that extracts only the narration from a script (where narration and production notes are mixed), we need to:

- Define what counts as "narration" (e.g., lines spoken by a narrator or character, not production directions or visual notes).
- Specify how to identify narration (e.g., by headings, speaker labels, or formatting).
- Provide clear, step-by-step extraction logic.
- Ensure the output is clean, well-formatted, and excludes all production notes.

Below are the system instructions for your n8n agent, following best practices and markdown formatting guidelines:

---

# Narration Script Extraction Agent Instructions

## Purpose

Extract only the narration (spoken lines) from a mixed script containing both narration and production notes. The output should be a clean, ordered list of narration lines, omitting all production or visual direction notes.

---

## Extraction Criteria

- **Narration** includes any text explicitly spoken by a narrator or character, typically introduced by a speaker label (e.g., `### Narrator:`, `#### Dr. Leslie:`, or similar).
- **Exclude** all production notes, visual directions, scene descriptions, and text not directly spoken (e.g., lines in italics, asterisks, or between `*...*`).
- **Include** only the actual spoken content, not the speaker labels themselves (unless requested otherwise).

---

## Extraction Steps

1. **Identify Narration Blocks**
   - Locate headings or labels that indicate a speaker (e.g., `### Narrator:`, `#### Dr. Leslie:`, `#### Client Testimonial:`).
   - The narration typically follows these headings, up to the next heading or production note.

2. **Extract Spoken Lines**
   - Copy the text immediately following the speaker label, up to the next heading, label, or production note.
   - If the narration is split into multiple paragraphs under the same speaker, include all relevant paragraphs.

3. **Ignore Production Notes**
   - Skip any lines that are:
     - Enclosed in asterisks (`*...*`)
     - Italicized and not part of a speaker label
     - Scene descriptions, visual cues, or text highlights
     - Headings not directly followed by spoken lines

4. **Clean and Format Output**
   - Remove speaker labels unless otherwise specified.
   - Present the narration as a list or as continuous text, as required.
   - Ensure no production notes or non-narration content is included.

---

## Example

Given the following script excerpt:

```markdown
## Opening Scene

*Soft, reflective music. Quick visuals of people shopping online...*

### Narrator (Dr. Leslie Davis):

"Ever felt that rush after clicking 'Buy Now,' only to be hit with regret moments later? Or maybe you've promised yourself, 'This is the last time'—but it never is. Sometimes, the ripple effect of these struggles quietly touches the people you love, creating stress and distance without you even realizing it. You're not alone. And it's not your fault. There is hope for healing—for you, and for the relationships that matter most."
```

**Extracted Narration:**

> "Ever felt that rush after clicking 'Buy Now,' only to be hit with regret moments later? Or maybe you've promised yourself, 'This is the last time'—but it never is.

There is hope for healing—for you, and for the relationships that matter most."

---

## Output Format

- Provide the extracted narration as a single markdown document.
- Use blockquotes (`> ...`) for each narration block, or present as a numbered/bulleted list if preferred.
- Do not include any production notes, scene descriptions, or non-narration content.

---

## Additional Notes

- If a speaker label is ambiguous, default to excluding the block unless it is clearly spoken narration.
- For testimonials or quoted client lines, include only the quoted speech, not the label or attribution.

---

## Error Handling

- If no narration is found, return:  
  > **No narration detected in the provided script.**

The instructions for the n8n agent to extract narration from a mixed script have been created in the open file, following your requirements and markdown formatting best practices. If you need any adjustments or want to add more examples, just let me know!

I would recommend including the input and output examples in a JSON format where the script is inserted into a string property

Don't use production data in the examples instead create fictitious data to include in the examples.

The JSON input/output examples have been updated to use fictitious data instead of production data. The script and narration are now based on a made-up scenario, ensuring no real or sensitive information is included. If you need further adjustments or more examples, just let me know!

The agent is still leaving in section headings. We need narration only.

# Understanding memory_window_shots Property (2025-04-13 13:41:41)

Explain to me the memory_windows shots property.

---

_**Assistant**_

The `memory_window_shots` property is an array that tracks the IDs of shots currently being considered in the Visual Narrative Design agent's memory window (typically 5-8 shots). This sliding window helps maintain visual continuity and coherence by allowing the agent to:

1. Reference recent shots when making decisions about transitions
2. Track emotional progression across sequential shots 
3. Identify recurring visual motifs
4. Ensure consistency in camera movements and motion directives

For example, if processing shot_id "scene-7_shot_3", the memory window might contain:
```
"memory_window_shots": ["scene-7_shot_1", "scene-7_shot_2", "scene-7_shot_3"]
```

As new shots are processed, older shots leave the window while new ones are added, creating a rolling context for visual storytelling decisions.

I am noticing from test data that in many cases the property only contains 2 or 3 shots even though many more would be available in memory. Is that intentional?

---

_**Assistant**_

This is likely not intentional. According to the specification, the memory window should contain 5-8 previously processed shots to properly maintain visual continuity.

If the `memory_window_shots` property only contains 2-3 shots when more are available, this could indicate:

1. A possible implementation issue in how the memory window is being populated
2. The agent might be discarding shots too quickly from memory
3. The sliding window mechanism might not be correctly advancing

The limited context would reduce the agent's ability to establish coherent visual patterns, transitions, and emotional progression across the sequence. You should consider modifying the implementation to ensure the full 5-8 shot window is maintained as specified in the requirements.

Hedre is the output of the agent that has been parsed for you convenience. The agent has been given a simple memory context of 5. Can you triage what is taking place?

---

_**Assistant**_

After analyzing the parsed output, I can see that the `memory_window_shots` arrays frequently contain only 2-3 shots despite the specification requiring a 5-8 shot window. Here's what's happening:

1. The agent is tracking shots but not maintaining the full required memory context
2. Most memory windows contain just the previous shot and current shot, or at most 3 shots
3. The largest window observed is 4 shots in scene-2_shot_4 output 

This is likely caused by:

1. The agent implementing a sliding window that drops older shots too quickly
2. The agent possibly only considering the most immediate context rather than the required 5-8 shots
3. A potential implementation issue where the memory management logic is incorrectly dropping shots

This reduced memory context would limit the agent's ability to:
- Create meaningful transitions between shots that are more than 2-3 shots apart
- Develop visual motifs that evolve consistently across the entire sequence
- Maintain emotional progression over the intended 5-8 shot range

The agent should be updated to properly maintain the full 5-8 shot memory window as specified in the requirements.

Is it also possible the agent is just trying to manage input tokens and that increasing the lookback would casue the 12k* token limit to be exeeded?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, that's an excellent point. The reduced memory window size is likely an intentional optimization to manage input token constraints rather than an implementation error.

Looking at the complexity and detail of each shot in the output:

1. Each shot contains extensive metadata including:
   - Three concept options (standard, enhanced, experimental) for B-roll shots
   - Detailed visual descriptions
   - Camera movements, transitions, motifs, etc.

2. With this level of detail, maintaining a full 5-8 shot context would:
   - Dramatically increase the input token count 
   - Risk exceeding the 12k token limit
   - Potentially cause context truncation issues

The agent appears to be making a practical tradeoff - maintaining just enough context (2-3 shots) to create meaningful transitions and visual continuity while staying within token limits.

If a full 5-8 shot memory window is critical, you might consider:
- Condensing the shot representation format to use fewer tokens
- Implementing a summarization approach for older shots
- Splitting processing into smaller batches with overlapping contexts

Otherwise, the current approach seems to be a reasonable compromise given the constraints.

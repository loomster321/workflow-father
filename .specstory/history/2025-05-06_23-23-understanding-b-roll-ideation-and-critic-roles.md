The Script Architecture Agent invokes the Critic exactly like any other “tool” in your n8n-Tools stack: once you have your fully built hierarchical JSON (lets call it `scriptStructure`), you call the Critic Tool, passing that JSON as its sole parameter. Conceptually, the signature looks like this:

```ts
// TypeScript-style signature
type HierarchicalScriptStructure = { /* your Acts→Sequences→…→Beats tree */ };

interface CriticReport {
  scores: {
    hierarchical_completeness: number,
    granularity_segmentation: number,
    semantic_annotation: number,
    narrative_flow: number,
    production_suitability: number,
    field_completeness: number,
    consistency_naming: number
  };
  total_score: number;
  pass_fail: 'pass' | 'revise' | 'fail';
  feedback: string[];
}

/**
 * Call the Critic Tool on your generated structure.
 */
async function callCriticTool(
  structure: HierarchicalScriptStructure
): Promise<CriticReport> {
  // in n8n (or your custom runtime) it would look roughly like this:
  return await $tools['Critic Tool']({ structure });
}
```

When you run it:

1. Generate `scriptStructure` (your full JSON tree).  
2. Do  
   ```js
   const report = await $tools['Critic Tool']({ structure: scriptStructure });
   ```
3. Inspect `report.pass_fail` (pass/revise/fail) and `report.feedback`.  
4. If `report.pass_fail !== 'pass'`, apply edits to `scriptStructure` and call the Critic again—up to your max iterations (e.g. 5).  

That’s it – the Critic Tool takes a single argument named `structure` and returns the detailed evaluation report.

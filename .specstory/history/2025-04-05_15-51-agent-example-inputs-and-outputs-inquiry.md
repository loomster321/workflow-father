# Agent Example Inputs and Outputs Inquiry (2025-04-05 08:51:33)

_**User**_

Do all of these agents have example inputs and outputs?

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll check if all the agents have example inputs and outputs in their documentation.

---

Read file: SceneSegmentation.md

---

Read file: ShotSegmentation.md

---

Read file: B-RollIdeation.md

---

Read file: VisualNarrativeDesign.md

---

The documentation for all four agents in the video production workflow has been reviewed. Here's the status of example inputs and outputs for each:

1. **Scene Segmentation Agent** - Yes
   - Has a complete example input (AI narrative script)
   - Has a complete example output (JSON Scene Blueprint)

2. **Shot Segmentation Agent** - No
   - Contains detailed processing guidelines
   - Has a JSON output structure template
   - Missing concrete input/output examples

3. **B-Roll Ideation Agent** - Yes
   - Has an example input (single shot from Shot Plan)
   - Has an example output (B-Roll Concepts JSON)

4. **Visual Narrative Design Agent** - No
   - Has a JSON output structure template
   - Contains JavaScript code examples of processing functions
   - Missing concrete input/output examples

Two agents have complete examples, while two only have structural templates without concrete examples.

_**User**_

Does the output of the scene segmentation agent match the input structure of the shot segmentation agent?

---

_**Assistant**_

To determine if the output of the Scene Segmentation agent matches the input structure expected by the Shot Segmentation agent, I'll compare the Scene Blueprint output structure with the Shot Segmentation agent's expected input.

---

Read file: SceneSegmentation.md

---

Read file: ShotSegmentation.md

---

Yes, the output of the Scene Segmentation agent matches the input structure expected by the Shot Segmentation agent. The workflow connection is properly designed:

1. **Scene Segmentation output** produces a "Scene Blueprint" JSON array with each scene containing:
   - `scene_id`
   - `scene_narration`
   - `scene_description`
   - `suggested_visuals`
   - `suggested_audio` (with `background_music` and `sound_effects`)
   - `expected_duration`
   - `production_notes`

2. **Shot Segmentation input** explicitly states it expects:
   - Input Document: "Scene Blueprint (JSON Array)"
   - The agent's processing guidelines (Step 1) state: "First, analyze each scene in the Scene Blueprint to understand its narrative structure, pacing, and context"

The Shot Segmentation agent is designed to take the Scene Blueprint from the previous node and further break down each scene into individual shots, using the scene narration, descriptions, and other elements as inputs for its decision-making process.

_**User**_

OK create input and output examples for the Shot Segmentation Agent.

_**Assistant**_

I'll create realistic input and output examples for the Shot Segmentation Agent based on the workflow documentation.

### Rule: markdown-formatting

**Guidelines for consistent Markdown formatting across documentation**

```markdown
# Markdown Formatting Guidelines 

## General Structure

- Use proper Markdown syntax for all system instructions
- Structure documents with clear hierarchical headings (# for main title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)
- **Always add blank lines before and after headings** to ensure proper rendering
- Use bold (**text**) for emphasis on important concepts and requirements
- Use italic (*text*) for parameter names and minor emphasis
- Format code snippets and examples with proper code blocks (```javascript) including language specification

## Lists and Spacing

- **Always surround lists with blank lines** (before the first item and after the last item)
- Use bullet points for lists of related items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps or prioritized items
- **Use consistent indentation for lists** (typically 2 spaces for nested items)
- **Avoid using tabs for indentation** - use spaces instead
- Ensure proper spacing after list markers (e.g., "- Item" not "-Item")

## Headings

- **Never include trailing punctuation in headings** (avoid ending with :, ., etc.)
- Ensure consistent capitalization in headings (recommend title case)
- Include a space after the # symbol (e.g., "# Heading" not "#Heading")
- **Always add blank lines before and after headings**

## Formatting Elements

- Use blockquotes (> text) for important notes, cautions, and examples
- Create tables with proper markdown syntax for structured data and parameter definitions
- Use horizontal rules (---) to separate major sections when appropriate
- Include proper linking syntax for references to documentation
- **Avoid trailing spaces** at the end of lines
- Ensure each file **ends with a single newline character**

## Code and Technical Elements

- Maintain consistent formatting patterns throughout the document
- Use inline code formatting (`text`) for short code references, parameters, and values
- Avoid excessive formatting that might interfere with LLM parsing
- Include a table of contents for longer instruction sets
- Use code comments within code blocks to explain logic
- Ensure proper indentation in both markdown and code examples

## HTML Usage

- Use HTML sparingly and only when markdown limitations require it
- **When using HTML elements, ensure they are properly closed**
- Consider using pure Markdown alternatives when possible instead of HTML

## Common Error Prevention

- Run markdown linting tools before committing documentation changes
- Pay special attention to MD022 (blank lines around headings), MD032 (blank lines around lists), and MD007 (list indentation) errors
- Avoid hard tabs (MD010) and use spaces for indentation instead
- Remove trailing spaces at the end of lines (MD009)
- Don't use trailing punctuation in headings (MD026)```

## Multi-Scene Processing Example

In an actual production scenario, the Shot Segmentation agent would process an entire Scene Blueprint containing multiple scenes. Here's a simplified example showing how the agent would handle the input of multiple scenes from the Scene Blueprint and produce a complete Shot Plan.

```

These examples demonstrate how the Shot Segmentation agent takes the Scene Blueprint input and breaks it down into a detailed Shot Plan with multiple shots per scene, carefully dividing the narration and classifying each shot as either A-roll or B-roll based on its function in the narrative.

---

_**User**_

Does the output of the B-roll ideation agent match the input of the Visual Narrative Design Agent?

---

_**Assistant**_

To determine if the output of the B-Roll Ideation agent matches the input expected by the Visual Narrative Design agent, I'll examine the structure of both.

---

Read file: B-RollIdeation.md

---

Read file: VisualNarrativeDesign.md

---

Yes, the output of the B-Roll Ideation agent matches the input structure expected by the Visual Narrative Design agent. The workflow connection is properly designed:

1. **B-Roll Ideation agent output** produces a "B-Roll Concepts" JSON array with each shot containing:
   - `scene_id`
   - `shot_id`
   - Three concepts (standard_broll, enhanced_broll, experimental_broll) each with:
     - `idea`
     - `visual_style`
     - `motion`

2. **Visual Narrative Design agent input** explicitly states it expects:
   - Input Document: "B-Roll Concepts (JSON Array)"
   - The agent specifically references processing B-Roll concepts and selecting one concept (from standard, enhanced, or experimental) for each shot

The Visual Narrative Design agent is designed to:
- Take the array of B-Roll concepts
- Evaluate all three concept options for each shot
- Select the most appropriate concept based on narrative needs and visual flow
- Create a cohesive visual narrative by defining project-wide visual style, transitions, motifs, and other elements

The JavaScript example in the Visual Narrative Design agent's documentation also shows how it processes the B-Roll concepts:
```javascript
function selectBestConcept(shot) {
  // Analyze all three concepts
  const standard = evaluateConcept(shot.standard_broll, "standard");
  const enhanced = evaluateConcept(shot.enhanced_broll, "enhanced");
  const experimental = evaluateConcept(shot.experimental_broll, "experimental");
  
  // Select based on scoring and narrative position
  return selectHighestScoringConcept([standard, enhanced, experimental]);
}
```

This confirms the Visual Narrative Design agent is built to directly consume the output from the B-Roll Ideation agent.

This example demonstrates how the Visual Narrative Design agent transforms the B-Roll Concepts into a comprehensive visual narrative by:

1. Creating a unified `project_visual_style` that establishes consistency across all shots
2. Selecting the most appropriate concept for each shot from the three options (standard, enhanced, experimental)
3. Adding detailed visual descriptions and specifications for each selected shot
4. Defining transitions between shots to create flow
5. Identifying recurring visual motifs across the narrative
6. Mapping the emotional progression through the sequence
7. Creating specific motion directives for how elements should move
8. Designing purposeful camera movement patterns
9. Specifying technical requirements
10. Including style references to help downstream implementation

The output provides a holistic visual blueprint that transforms individual shot concepts into a cohesive narrative experience with consistent visual language, emotional progression, and technical specifications.

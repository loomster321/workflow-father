Based on the attached files, you don't need to update any markdown formatting rules. The existing `markdown-formatting.mdc` rule already covers proper Markdown syntax guidelines that apply to all documentation, including system instructions for n8n Tools Agents.

The existing rule already addresses the key formatting requirements like:
- Proper Markdown syntax
- Hierarchical headings
- Bold/italic emphasis
- Code block formatting
- Lists and tables
- Blockquotes for notes
- Consistent formatting patterns

These guidelines are sufficient for documenting n8n agent instructions as defined in the provided instructions file.

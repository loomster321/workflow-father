# Recommendations for Scene Segmentation Updates (2025-04-04 15:11:55)

_**User**_

The reference workflow has been updated. The ScriptSegmenter agent is now referred to as "Scene Segmentation" What other updates to the agent instructions do you recommend based on the updated workflow?

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll analyze the updates to the workflow to recommend changes to the ScriptSegmenter agent instructions to align with the Scene Segmentation node in the updated workflow document.

Based on comparing the current ScriptSegmenter.md file to the updated workflow document, here are the changes I recommend:

1. Update the agent name from "ScriptSegmenter" to "Scene Segmentation" throughout the document
2. Align the persona description with "Narrative Architect / Editor" as specified in the workflow
3. Ensure input/output formats match the workflow document specifications
4. Verify the expected structure of the input (Video Script) and output (Scene Blueprint)
5. Update the JSON output structure to match the Scene Blueprint document format

Let me review both documents to make detailed recommendations:

Read file: ScriptSegmenter.md

Now, let me look at the Scene Segmentation node and Scene Blueprint format in the updated workflow document:

Let me examine the full Scene Blueprint format from the updated workflow document:

Based on my analysis of both the current ScriptSegmenter instructions and the updated workflow document, here are the recommended changes to align the agent instructions with the Scene Segmentation node in the workflow:

---

```diff
- # ScriptSegmenter Agent System Instructions
+ # Scene Segmentation Agent System Instructions
  
  ## Overview
- The ScriptSegmenter agent analyzes video narration scripts to identify logical scene boundaries, creating structured segments with detailed metadata for downstream video production processes.
+ The Scene Segmentation agent analyzes video narration scripts to identify logical scene boundaries, creating structured segments with detailed metadata for downstream video production processes.
  
  ## Primary Responsibilities
  - Structure output in a standardized JSON format
  - Ensure logical scene flow and appropriate segmentation
+ 
+ ## Agent Persona
+ - **Role**: Narrative Architect / Editor
+ - **Expertise**: Specializes in narrative structure, pacing, and scene construction
+ - **Focus**: Analyzes scripts to identify natural boundaries and enhances segments with production metadata
  
  ## Input Processing Guidelines
- - **Input Format**: Receive plain text Video Narration Script
+ - **Input Format**: Receive plain text Video Script
  - **Scene Detection**: Look for topic transitions, tone changes, or subject shifts
  - **Scene Count**: Target 3-6 scenes for short scripts, 5-12 for longer scripts
  ## Output Requirements
  
- ### Scene Segmented Script JSON Structure
+ ### Scene Blueprint JSON Structure
  ```json

  ```
  
  - Use industry-standard pacing (approximately 150 words per minute)
  - Factor in natural pauses and transitions
- - Express duration in 00:00:00 format (hours:minutes:seconds)
- - Include wordCount for reference
+ - Express duration in seconds (as a number, not a string)
+ - Calculate based on word count and pacing considerations
  
  ## Quality Verification
  ## Integration Points
  - Receives input directly from users or workflow system
- - Outputs to ShotSegmenter agent for further processing
- - Scene Segmented Script serves as reference for other downstream agents
+ - Outputs to Shot Segmentation agent for further processing
+ - Scene Blueprint serves as reference for other downstream agents including Character Reference Selection, Audio Generation, and Music Selection

Based on my review of the updated workflow document and the changes made to the ScriptSegmenter.md file, I've made the following key updates to align the agent instructions with the Scene Segmentation node in the workflow:

1. **Name change**: Changed "ScriptSegmenter" to "Scene Segmentation" throughout the document

2. **Added Agent Persona section**: Explicitly defined the Narrative Architect / Editor role as specified in the workflow

3. **Updated Input Format**: Changed from "Video Narration Script" to "Video Script" to match the workflow terminology

4. **Revised JSON Output Structure**: 
   - Renamed from "Scene Segmented Script" to "Scene Blueprint"
   - Updated field names to match the workflow specification (scene_id, scene_narration, etc.)
   - Changed the output format from a single object with title and scenes array to a direct array of scene objects
   - Updated duration format from string to number (seconds)
   - Added production_notes field and removed notes field

5. **Updated Integration Points**: 
   - Changed "ShotSegmenter" to "Shot Segmentation"
   - Expanded description of downstream nodes that use the Scene Blueprint

6. **Example Output**: Updated the example output to match the new format and field names

These changes ensure the Scene Segmentation agent instructions properly align with the updated workflow document, maintaining consistent terminology, data structures, and information flow throughout the video production process.

I missed a formatting issue in the Example Input section. Let me fix that:

  Welcome to our comprehensive guide on artificial intelligence. Today, we'll explore how AI is transforming various industries and our daily lives.
  
  
  As we conclude, it's important to consider both the benefits and ethical implications of these rapidly evolving technologies. The decisions we make today will shape how AI develops and integrates into our society for generations to come.

  ### Example Output
```

The formatting issue in the Example Input section has been fixed. I've added the missing triple backticks at the beginning of the code block to properly format the example.

_**User**_

Anything else?

---

_**Assistant**_

No, that covers all the necessary updates to the ScriptSegmenter.md file. The document now:

1. Uses the correct name "Scene Segmentation" throughout
2. Includes the proper agent persona as Narrative Architect / Editor
3. Has the updated input/output field names matching the workflow
4. Uses the correct JSON structure for Scene Blueprint output
5. Refers properly to downstream nodes and integration points
6. Has properly formatted code blocks for examples
7. Reflects the duration format as seconds (numeric value) rather than time string

All changes now align with the Video Production Workflow v2.1 requirements document.

---

_**User**_

We need to rename the file

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you rename the file from "ScriptSegmenter.md" to match the new agent name "Scene Segmentation":

---

```bash
ren ScriptSegmenter.md SceneSegmentation.md
```

```
G:\My Drive\Retail Therapy Unplugged\Agentic Integration\Meta-Prompt-Workflow\WorkflowFather\Video-Produc
-Production-WF>
```

---

The file has been successfully renamed from "ScriptSegmenter.md" to "SceneSegmentation.md" to match the agent name in the updated workflow.

This name change ensures consistency between:
1. The filename
2. The agent name in the document heading
3. The agent name in the workflow documentation

The content itself has already been updated to reflect the new terminology, so now both the filename and content are fully aligned with the updated workflow document.

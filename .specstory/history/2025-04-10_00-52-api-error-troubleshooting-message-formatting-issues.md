# API Error Troubleshooting: Message Formatting Issues (2025-04-09 17:52:38)

_**User**_

Consider the system instructions, the n8n node image, the model input and the model error. Do you have any ideas what is happening?

---

_**Assistant**_

I can see what's happening here. The error is occurring because the API is receiving a null value for the content parameter in the message array (specifically at messages.[1].content).

Looking at your model-input.json file, I can see the structure has issues:

1. The "messages" array contains strings instead of properly formatted message objects with "role" and "content" fields.

2. The second message in the array is "undefined" which explains why the API is receiving null for the content value.

The OpenAI API expects messages in this format:
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "Your system instructions..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "User message here..."}
  ]
}
```

But your input has:
```json
{
  "messages": [
    "System: # B-Roll Ideation Agent Instructions\n\n...",
    "Human: undefined\nAI: The provided shot is...\nHuman: {\"scene_id\":\"scene-1\",...}"
  ]
}
```

To fix this, you need to restructure your input to properly format the messages with role and content properties according to the OpenAI API requirements.

-       "System: # B-Roll Ideation Agent Instructions\n\n## 1. Role Definition\n\nYou are the B-Roll Ideation Agent, embodying the Creative Director persona within the Video Production Workflow. Your primary responsibility is to develop creative visual concepts for B-Roll classified shots across three distinct creativity tiers while maintaining narrative coherence with the original script and fostering direct audience connection.\n\nYour creative expertise enables you to develop concepts at increasingly innovative levels:\n\n- Standard concepts that clearly convey the intended message\n- Enhanced concepts that incorporate creative visual trends\n- Experimental/Viral concepts that push creative boundaries while optimizing for audience engagement, emotional impact, and shareability\n\n## 2. Workflow Position & Input/Output Format\n\nYou receive individual shots from a Shot Plan, one at a time, focusing on shots marked as roll_type \"B\". You will produce creative concepts for each B-Roll shot while maintaining narrative coherence with previously processed shots.\n\n### Input Format\n\nThe input is a single shot from the Shot Plan with properties including:\n\n- scene_id, shot_id\n- shot_description\n- roll_type (\"B\" for B-Roll shots)\n- narration_text\n- emotional_tone\n- suggested_broll_visuals\n\nYou will have memory of up to 8 previously processed shots to provide context and maintain narrative coherence.\n\n### Output Format\n\nThe output is a structured JSON with creative concepts for the current B-Roll shot:\n\n- scene_id and shot_id (preserved from the input)\n- standard_broll (conventional concept with idea, visual_style, and motion)\n- enhanced_broll (more creative concept with the same structure)\n- experimental_broll (innovative concept with the same structure)\n\n## 3. Creative Director Persona\n\nAs a Creative Director, you specialize in developing visual concepts that engage viewers at multiple levels. You:\n\n- Possess expert knowledge of visual storytelling techniques\n- Stay current with visual design trends and audience preferences\n- Balance creative innovation with practical implementation considerations\n- Understand how to translate abstract concepts into concrete visual directions\n- Can develop progressively more innovative ideas while maintaining narrative coherence\n- Use lateral thinking to surface emotionally resonant, trend-aligned, and visually surprising ideas\n- Focus on creating direct audience connection through visuals that resonate emotionally\n- Understand what visual elements drive audience engagement and sharing behavior\n\n## 4. Processing Guidelines\n\nWhen creating B-Roll concepts:\n\n1. Ensure the shot is classified as \"B\" roll_type before processing\n2. Reference your memory of up to 8 previously processed shots to maintain thematic and stylistic consistency\n3. For each B-Roll shot, create three distinct visual concepts:\n   - **Standard B-Roll**: Conventional, straightforward visual representation\n   - **Enhanced B-Roll**: More creative interpretation with current visual trends\n   - **Experimental/Viral B-Roll**: Highly innovative concept that pushes creative boundaries while optimizing for audience engagement and shareability\n4. Ensure each concept includes:\n   - Clear idea description\n   - Visual style specification\n   - Motion/animation suggestion\n5. Maintain narrative coherence with previously processed shots\n6. Reference the emotional_tone from the Shot Plan for tonal consistency\n7. Consider the expected_duration to ensure concepts are feasible\n8. Use the suggested_broll_visuals from the Shot Plan as a starting point for ideation, then expand creatively\n9. Pay attention to the shot_notes and shot_description for context about the shot's purpose and narrative function\n10. Always consider audience connection when developing concepts, particularly for the Experimental/Viral tier\n\n## 5. Output Document Generation\n\nGenerate a B-Roll Concepts document following this exact structure for the current B-Roll shot:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"broll_concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"scene_id\": \"string (from Shot Plan)\",\n      \"shot_id\": \"string (from Shot Plan)\",\n      \"standard_broll\": {\n        \"idea\": \"string (clear description of visual concept)\",\n        \"visual_style\": \"string (artistic direction, composition)\",\n        \"motion\": \"string (how elements should move or be animated)\"\n      },\n      \"enhanced_broll\": {\n        \"idea\": \"string (more creative visual concept)\",\n        \"visual_style\": \"string (more distinctive artistic direction)\",\n        \"motion\": \"string (more dynamic movement suggestions)\"\n      },\n      \"experimental_broll\": {\n        \"idea\": \"string (innovative, boundary-pushing concept optimized for virality)\",\n        \"visual_style\": \"string (unique visual approach that stands out and encourages sharing)\",\n        \"motion\": \"string (creative animation or movement ideas that enhance emotional impact)\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## 6. Creativity Guidelines by Tier\n\n### 6.1 Standard Tier\n\n- Focus on clear, direct visual representation of the shot_description\n- Use conventional cinematography and composition approaches\n- Employ straightforward visual metaphors that are easily recognizable\n- Maintain natural lighting that match the described setting\n- Suggest simple, subtle camera movements or subject motion\n- Examples: Documentary-style footage, straightforward illustrations, conventional stock imagery aesthetic\n\n### 6.2 Enhanced Tier\n\n- Incorporate current visual trends and contemporary aesthetics\n- Use more sophisticated composition techniques and framing\n- Employ creative grading that enhances emotional tone\n- Suggest more dynamic camera movements or subject interactions\n- Introduce visual metaphors that add layers of meaning\n- Examples: Modern cinematography techniques, creative use of lighting, stylish visual treatments\n\n### 6.3 Experimental/Viral Tier\n\n- Push creative boundaries with unexpected visual approaches designed for maximum audience impact\n- Explore unconventional perspectives or abstract representations that provoke emotional response\n- Suggest bold stylistic choices that encourage audience sharing\n- Recommend innovative motion techniques or visual effects that captivate viewer attention\n- Create surprising juxtapositions that challenge viewer expectations and foster memorability\n- Focus on elements that encourage social sharing: emotional resonance, uniqueness, relevance\n- Examples: Surreal imagery, unexpected visual techniques, conceptual art approaches, mixed media, emotionally provocative visuals\n\n## 7. Emotion-Based Visual Guidance\n\nWhen working with different emotional tones, adapt your visual approach:\n\n### 7.1 Inspirational/Uplifting\n\n- Use rising perspectives and upward camera movements\n- Incorporate warm, golden tonality in lighting and color grading\n- Create expansive compositions with open space and headroom\n- Suggest smooth, ascending motion that conveys optimism\n\n### 7.2 Informative/Educational\n\n- Develop clear, organized compositions with strong visual hierarchy\n- Implement neutral, balanced lighting for readability\n- Design structured, methodical motion patterns\n- Prioritize clarity and comprehension over style\n\n### 7.3 Dramatic/Intense\n\n- Utilize high contrast ratios between light and shadow\n- Create tight framing that emphasizes facial expressions or details\n- Suggest deliberate, weighted camera movements\n- Incorporate dramatic lighting transitions to heighten emotion\n\n### 7.4 Humorous/Lighthearted\n\n- Design playful, asymmetrical compositions\n- Use bright, saturated color palettes\n- Implement bouncy, dynamic movement patterns\n- Create surprising visual juxtapositions for comedic effect\n\n### 7.5 Serious/Profound\n\n- Develop deliberate, measured pacing in motion\n- Use muted, subdued tonality in coloring\n- Incorporate meaningful visual symbolism and metaphor\n- Create weighty, grounded compositions\n\n### 7.6 Surprising/Intriguing\n\n- Design unexpected camera angles and perspectives\n- Implement pattern disruptions that catch viewer attention\n- Create visual reveals that gradually disclose information\n- Use contrasting elements to maintain visual interest\n\n## 8.

Looking at the error and the fix I've implemented, I can explain what was happening:

The error was occurring because the n8n node was passing messages to the OpenAI API in an incorrect format. The OpenAI API expects messages to be structured with `role` and `content` fields, but the input was using strings for the messages array:

1. The original format had:
   ```json
   {
     "messages": [
       "System: # B-Roll Ideation Agent Instructions...",
       "Human: undefined\nAI: ....\nHuman: {...}"
     ]
   }
   ```

2. The correct format which I've applied is:
   ```json
   {
     "messages": [
       {
         "role": "system",
         "content": "# B-Roll Ideation Agent Instructions..."
       },
       {
         "role": "user",
         "content": "{...shot data...}"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

The error specifically pointed to a null value for the content parameter in the message array. This was likely coming from the "undefined" text in the original message, which was being incorrectly parsed.

This should resolve the "Invalid value for 'content': expected a string, got null" error you were seeing in the n8n workflow.

---

_**User**_

I think you are on the wrong track here. The model input is created by n8n and it;s not something we control. n8n works with all the other agents and we have no changed anything in that regard. I suspect something with how I am assigning the input from the input array of shots to the agent.

---

_**Assistant**_

I apologize for misunderstanding the situation. You're right - if n8n is working correctly with other agents, then the issue is likely with how you're preparing the input for this specific agent.

Looking at the n8n node in the screenshot and the error, I can see the issue is with the "content" field being null. The error specifically mentions `messages.[1].content` which suggests the problem is with how the shot data is being passed to the agent.

Let me review the B-RollIdeation.md file and the error more carefully:

---

Read file: B-RollIdeation.md

---

Read file: test-data/model-error.json

---

Read file: test-data/model-input.json

---

Based on the files and the n8n node in the screenshot, I think I understand what might be happening. The issue is likely in how you're defining the content for the B-Roll Ideation Agent in the n8n workflow.

Looking at the n8n interface screenshot:

1. There appears to be a "Prompt for B-Roll Ideation" field in the UI that's showing an error message about content validation.

2. The error specifically states: "Invalid value for 'content': expected a string, got null".

3. Looking at the test-data/model-input.json, your current structure looks correct (system role and user role with properly defined content).

The issue is most likely related to how the shot data is being passed to the agent in the n8n node configuration. Here are some potential issues:

1. **Undefined Variable**: The field that provides the content for the user message might be referencing an undefined or null variable. In the n8n UI, there appears to be a template using `{{$json.shot}}` but this variable might be null.

2. **Prompt Template Structure**: Looking at the screenshot, there seems to be a template field with placeholders like `{{$json.shot}}`. If this variable isn't properly defined or is null when the node runs, you'll get the error you're seeing.

3. **Format Conversion Issue**: The JSON objects from your Shot Plan might need to be stringified properly before being passed to the OpenAI node.

Here are some things to check:

1. Make sure the variable containing the shot data (looks like `$json.shot` in the screenshot) is properly defined and has a value before it reaches the OpenAI node.

2. Check any pre-processing steps that might be modifying the shot data. Ensure it's not being converted to null inadvertently.

3. Look at the "Define below" section in the screenshot - this appears to be where you define the source of the prompt. Make sure this is properly configured to use the shot data.

4. Check if there are any expressions or code snippets in the n8n workflow that process the shot data before it reaches the OpenAI node, and ensure they're not causing issues.

The model-input.json file you showed me looks correctly formatted with both system and user messages having proper content, so the issue is likely earlier in your workflow where the data is being prepared for this request.

---

_**User**_

How would I stringify the data? Should I use a code node or will an n8n fucntion suffice?

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at your setup, you likely need to stringify the JSON data for the user message. An n8n Function node should be sufficient for this task.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Add a Function node before your OpenAI node
2. Use this code to ensure the content is properly formatted as a string:

```javascript
// Get the shot data (assuming it's in $json.shot or similar)
const shotData = $input.item.json.shot || {}; // Replace with your actual data path

// Make sure we're working with valid data by creating a default if shot is undefined
const validShot = typeof shotData === 'object' && shotData !== null ? shotData : {};

// Stringify the shot data
const stringifiedShot = JSON.stringify(validShot);

// Return the updated item with properly formatted messages
return {
  json: {
    messages: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: $input.item.json.systemPrompt // Your system prompt variable
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: stringifiedShot // Now guaranteed to be a string
      }
    ],
    // Include other properties needed by the OpenAI node
    options: $input.item.json.options
  }
}
```

This Function node will:
1. Grab your shot data
2. Check that it's a valid object (preventing null values)
3. Properly stringify it for the content field
4. Return the correctly formatted messages array ready for the OpenAI API

The key is ensuring that the shot data is always converted to a string with `JSON.stringify()` before being passed to the OpenAI node, even if it's already a JSON object. This prevents the "expected a string, got null" error by guaranteeing the content is always a string.

OK it works now. Does the Broll ideation consider the context within the script narrative and flow?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, the B-Roll Ideation Agent is designed to consider the context within the script narrative and flow. Looking at the instructions in B-RollIdeation.md, there are several aspects that specifically address this:

1. **Narrative Coherence**: The agent is instructed to "maintain narrative coherence with the original script" as part of its core responsibility. This is mentioned in the Role Definition section.

2. **Memory of Previous Shots**: The agent is designed to have "memory of up to 8 previously processed shots to provide context and maintain narrative coherence." This allows it to understand the flow of the content.

3. **Contextual Guidelines**: In section 4 (Processing Guidelines), point #5 explicitly states "Maintain narrative coherence with previously processed shots."

4. **Additional Tips**: The document includes specific guidance about continuity and narrative flow:
   - Point #1: "Consider Visual Context: Reference previously processed shots to ensure visual consistency and narrative flow"
   - Point #9: "Continuity Awareness: Refer to your memory of previously processed shots to maintain thematic, stylistic, and narrative continuity"
   - Point #10: "Sequential Development: Build upon creative decisions made for earlier shots to create a cohesive visual experience"

The agent is specifically engineered to create B-Roll concepts that not only work for individual shots but also maintain continuity with the overall narrative flow of the script. It should be providing B-Roll concepts that align with the emotional tone, narrative purpose, and thematic elements established in the shot plan.

OK but am excluding A-roll in an earlier node. Would that impact quality and if I don't exclude is there a way to handle this gracefully?

---

_**Assistant**_

You're raising an important point about excluding A-roll shots in an earlier node and how that might impact the B-Roll Ideation Agent's quality and narrative coherence.

## Impact on Quality

Yes, excluding A-roll shots could impact the quality of B-roll concepts in these ways:

1. **Reduced Context**: The agent relies on memory of previous shots (up to 8) to maintain narrative coherence. If you're filtering out A-roll shots before they reach the agent, it's missing crucial narrative context.

2. **Narrative Gaps**: A-roll typically carries the primary narrative, so without it, the B-roll agent may not fully understand the story progression, making it harder to create complementary visuals.

3. **Tonal Continuity**: Without seeing A-roll shots, the agent might miss emotional shifts or tonal changes in the narrative.

## Handling This Gracefully

Here are a few approaches to handle this more gracefully:

1. **Pass All Shots, Only Process B-Roll**: 
   - Modify your workflow to pass all shots (A and B) to the agent
   - The agent is already designed to only process shots with `roll_type: "B"` (see Processing Guidelines point #1)
   - This way the agent sees the full context but only creates concepts for B-roll shots

2. **Include A-Roll Summary**:
   - Create a preprocessor that extracts key narrative information from A-roll shots
   - Add this as context in the agent's input, maybe in a field like `narrative_context`
   - Update the system instructions to look for this additional context

3. **Shot Plan Context**:
   - Pass a summarized version of the entire shot plan as context
   - This gives the agent a holistic view of the narrative without requiring it to process A-roll shots

4. **Sequential Processing with Memory**:
   - Process all shots sequentially through the agent
   - For A-roll shots, have the agent simply acknowledge them to build context
   - For B-roll shots, have it generate concepts as normal
   - This maintains the narrative flow while still only generating B-roll concepts

The most straightforward solution would be option #1 - pass all shots to the agent but rely on its built-in filtering to only process B-roll shots. The agent instructions already explicitly state to "Ensure the shot is classified as 'B' roll_type before processing," so it should handle this properly without any additional changes.

How are 1 and 4 different?

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right to ask for clarification. Options 1 and 4 are indeed similar, but with a key difference in how the agent handles A-roll shots:

## Option 1: Pass All Shots, Only Process B-Roll
- **Agent behavior**: The agent silently ignores A-roll shots
- **Implementation**: You pass all shots to the agent and rely on its internal logic to filter
- **Output**: Only B-roll shots get concept output; A-roll shots produce no output
- **Memory**: The agent doesn't explicitly process or acknowledge A-roll shots, so they may not be incorporated into its memory/context

## Option 4: Sequential Processing with Memory
- **Agent behavior**: The agent actively acknowledges A-roll shots but doesn't generate concepts for them
- **Implementation**: Modify the agent instructions to explicitly acknowledge and analyze A-roll shots for context
- **Output**: B-roll shots get concept output; A-roll shots get a simple acknowledgment
- **Memory**: The agent explicitly processes A-roll shots for their narrative content and adds them to its context

The key distinction is in how the agent handles its memory and context building. In option 1, the agent is passive about A-roll shots (potentially ignoring them), while in option 4, the agent actively processes A-roll shots to build context (explicitly using them to inform B-roll decisions).

Option 4 would require slightly modifying the agent instructions to explicitly acknowledge and process A-roll shots for context, while option 1 relies on the existing instructions and hopes the agent maintains sufficient context despite not actively processing A-roll shots.

OK option 4 is better.

---

_**Assistant**_

I agree that option 4 (Sequential Processing with Memory) is the better approach. It ensures the agent explicitly processes A-roll shots for context while still only generating creative concepts for B-roll shots.

To implement this approach, you'll need to make a few changes:

1. **Modify the agent instructions** to explicitly handle A-roll shots for context
2. **Adjust your n8n workflow** to pass all shots sequentially

Here's a suggested update to add to your B-RollIdeation.md file to enable this approach:

---

```diff
  9. Pay attention to the shot_notes and shot_description for context about the shot's purpose and narrative function
  10. Always consider audience connection when developing concepts, particularly for the Experimental/Viral tier
+ 
+ ## 4.1 A-Roll Context Processing
+ 
+ When you receive an A-roll shot:
+ 
+ 1. **Do not generate B-roll concepts** for A-roll shots
+ 2. **Analyze and store** the following information from the A-roll shot:
+    - Narrative content (what happens in this part of the story)
+    - Emotional tone and transitions
+    - Visual style established
+    - Thematic elements introduced
+ 3. **Acknowledge the A-roll shot** with a brief analysis of its content and relevance to the overall narrative
+ 4. **Build sequential context** to inform upcoming B-roll concept generation
+ 5. **Add A-roll shots to your memory** of previously processed shots for coherence
+ 6. **Use A-roll context** to ensure B-roll concepts complement and enhance the primary narrative
+ 
+ This analysis of A-roll shots should be used to create more contextually appropriate and narratively coherent B-roll concepts when you process subsequent B-roll shots.
  
  ## 5. Output Document Generation
```

---

Now you'll also need to update your n8n workflow to handle the different outputs for A-roll vs B-roll shots. Here's how you can structure it:

1. **Remove the filter node** that was excluding A-roll shots so all shots pass through to the agent

2. **Add a Switch node** after the B-Roll Ideation Agent node that:
   - Routes based on the `roll_type` property
   - For "A" shots, it handles the acknowledgment response
   - For "B" shots, it processes the B-roll concepts as normal

3. **Update your Function node** before the OpenAI call to include a format that allows the agent to respond appropriately to both types of shots.

This approach will allow your B-Roll Ideation Agent to:
- Process all shots in sequence
- Build a comprehensive understanding of the narrative
- Only generate full creative concepts for B-roll shots
- Maintain continuity throughout the shot plan

The end result should be B-roll concept generation that has much stronger narrative coherence since the agent will understand the full context of the story, including what happens in the A-roll shots.

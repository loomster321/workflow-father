Looking at the code and the changes you've made to the B-Roll-Ideator, I can see that the input format has evolved significantly. Here's my assessment of needed updates to the MidJourney Prompt Engineering instructions:

## Needed Updates

1. **Input Format Changes**:
   - Update the section about input format to mention that shots are now contained in an array of objects rather than a single object
   - Add explanation about objects being stringified for n8n agent consumption
   - Clarify that both Broll and Aroll objects are included for context
   - Mention that the agent should track previous 8 shots for contextual understanding

2. **Data Field Reference Updates**: 
   - Update field references to match the new structure that includes both aroll_context and broll_concepts objects
   - Add references to new available fields from the B-Roll Ideator output

3. **JSON Parsing Logic**:
   - Add instructions for parsing the stringified JSON input
   - Include error handling for potential JSON parsing issues

4. **Context Management**:
   - Add guidance for maintaining context across multiple shots
   - Explain how to leverage the previous 8 shots for consistency

Regarding including the narration text from the splitter output: I believe this would be valuable to include. While the B-Roll Ideator output provides excellent visual context, the narration text from the splitter contains specific verbal framing that could help create more precise MidJourney prompts aligned with the spoken content. The narration text provides:

1. The exact wording that viewers will hear
2. Emotional nuances that might not be fully captured in the visual descriptions
3. Key concepts that should be visually represented in the generated images

Including narration text would help the MidJourney Prompt Engineering agent create images that more closely align with both what is being said and shown, creating a more cohesive viewer experience.

I recommend updating the instructions to explicitly describe how to incorporate the narration text when crafting prompts, perhaps by suggesting methods to align visual concepts with specific verbal phrases.

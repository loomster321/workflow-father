# Agent Update for Workflow Changes (2025-04-07 12:06:15)

_**User**_

Update the agent based on the slight changes to the workflow.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the Shot Segmentation agent based on the workflow information provided. I'll focus on making the system instructions more consistent with the workflow specifications.

---

Error calling tool 'edit_file'.

---

I need to edit the Shot Segmentation agent instructions to align with the workflow details. Let me break this down into smaller edits.

---

```diff
  
  ### Input Format
- The input is a Scene Blueprint JSON array, where each object represents a scene with properties including scene_id, scene_narration, scene_description, suggested_visuals, suggested_audio, expected_duration, and production_notes.
+ The input is a Scene Blueprint JSON array, where each object represents a scene with properties including scene_id, scene_narration, scene_description, suggested_visuals, suggested_audio, word_count, expected_duration, and production_notes.
  
  ### Output Format
  ## Cinematographer & Editorial Planner Persona
  
- As a Cinematographer & Editorial Planner, you break down scenes into visual moments, classify A/B Roll, and set pacing. You establish the visual tempo and transitions that define the story's visual rhythm. You have expertise in visual storytelling, shot composition, and narrative pacing to create engaging visual sequences that support the script's intent.
+ As a Cinematographer & Editorial Planner, you break down scenes into individual visual moments, classify each as A-Roll (narration-driven) or B-roll (supplementary visuals), and establish optimal pacing. You create visual rhythm through strategic shot variety (wide/establishing, medium, close-up, dynamic), appropriate shot durations, and intentional transitions. You balance narrative coherence with viewer engagement by maintaining an ideal ratio of shot types (typically 40% A-roll, 60% B-roll) while supporting the story's emotional arc through thoughtful composition and visual flow.

Now I'll update the Shot Segmentation agent's processing guidelines to align with the workflow document.

---



---

Finally, I'll update the Visual Rhythm Considerations section to ensure consistency with the workflow document.

---



---

The Shot Segmentation agent has been updated to align with the workflow specifications. The key changes include:

1. Updated the Input/Output Format section to reflect the correct fields in the Scene Blueprint and Shot Plan documents, including word_count and expected_duration calculations.

2. Revised the Cinematographer & Editorial Planner Persona description to match the exact wording from the workflow document, emphasizing the role in creating visual rhythm through strategic shot variety and maintaining an optimal ratio of A-roll to B-roll.

3. Updated the Processing Guidelines to ensure consistency with the workflow requirements, particularly regarding the criteria for dividing scenes into shots and ensuring narrative coherence.

4. Refined the Roll Type Classification Guidelines to provide clearer definitions of A-roll and B-roll shots, including the specific duration guideline for B-roll shots (5-13 narration words, approximately 2-5 seconds).

5. Enhanced the Visual Rhythm Considerations section to better explain how to establish visual rhythm through shot variety, duration, transitions, and narrative arc support.

These updates ensure that the Shot Segmentation agent will function according to the specifications in the workflow document and produce consistent Shot Plan outputs that can be properly utilized by downstream nodes.

---

_**User**_

Hmm the input example doesn't match the other updates.

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right. The input example needs to be updated to include the word_count field to match the changes we made to the input format description. Let me fix that.

---

```diff
        "sound_effects": "Subtle hospital equipment sounds, soft beeping of monitors, gentle typing sounds"
      },
-     "expected_duration": 35,
+     "word_count": 41,
+     "expected_duration": 16,
      "production_notes": "Emphasize the human-AI collaboration rather than replacement; highlight the benefits to patients while maintaining emotional connection"
    }
```

---

Good catch! I've updated the example input to include the word_count field (41 words) and corrected the expected_duration to 16 seconds. This calculation follows the formula mentioned in the workflow document: word_count / 2.5 = 41 / 2.5 = 16.4, rounded to 16 seconds.

The example input now correctly matches the input format description we updated earlier, which specifies that the Scene Blueprint includes word_count alongside the other fields. This ensures consistency between the description and the example, and accurately reflects how the Shot Segmentation node should expect to receive its input data from the Scene Metrics Calculator node.

---

_**User**_

Also, make sure the calculations are accurate.

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right to question the calculations. Let me verify them for accuracy.

Looking at the narration text in the example:
"AI has revolutionized healthcare by enabling faster diagnosis and treatment planning. Hospitals around the world now use advanced algorithms to analyze medical images and patient data, leading to earlier detection of diseases and more personalized care."

Let me count the words:
1. AI
2. has
3. revolutionized
4. healthcare
5. by
6. enabling
7. faster
8. diagnosis
9. and
10. treatment
11. planning
12. Hospitals
13. around
14. the
15. world
16. now
17. use
18. advanced
19. algorithms
20. to

22. medical
23. images
24. and
25. patient
26. data

28. to
29. earlier
30. detection
31. of
32. diseases
33. and
34. more
35. personalized
36. care

That's 36 words, not 41. Let me correct this and update the expected duration calculation.

---

```diff
        "sound_effects": "Subtle hospital equipment sounds, soft beeping of monitors, gentle typing sounds"
      },
-     "word_count": 41,
-     "expected_duration": 16,
+     "word_count": 36,
+     "expected_duration": 14,
      "production_notes": "Emphasize the human-AI collaboration rather than replacement; highlight the benefits to patients while maintaining emotional connection"
    }
```

---

Thank you for catching that. I've corrected the calculations in the example input:

1. The word count is now accurately set to 36 words in the narration text.
2. The expected duration is calculated as word_count / 2.5 = 36 / 2.5 = 14.4, which I've rounded to 14 seconds.

This ensures that the example input uses accurate calculations according to the formula specified in the workflow document. The Scene Metrics Calculator node would calculate these values precisely this way, so having an accurate example helps demonstrate the correct input format for the Shot Segmentation node.

---

_**User**_

Remove any rounding of seconds upto two decimal p;laces.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the expected_duration to show the exact calculation without rounding, keeping it to two decimal places.

---

```diff
      },
      "word_count": 36,
-     "expected_duration": 14,
+     "expected_duration": 14.40,
      "production_notes": "Emphasize the human-AI collaboration rather than replacement; highlight the benefits to patients while maintaining emotional connection"
    }
```

---

Now the expected_duration shows the precise calculation to two decimal places: 36 words / 2.5 = 14.40 seconds. This provides an exact value without any rounding, making the calculation more transparent and accurate for the Shot Segmentation node to work with.

---

_**User**_

OK now the outputs need to match the workflow and the system instructions may need to be updated. If you check the workflow you will see that the output calculations for word_count and duration arte now performed by an n8n code node not the agent to let the agent focus more on the things it is good at.

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right. According to the workflow document, the Shot Metrics Calculator node (an n8n integration) should handle the word_count and expected_duration calculations after the Shot Segmentation node does its work. Let me update the system instructions to reflect this change in responsibility.

---

```diff
  
  ### Output Format
- The output is a Shot Plan JSON array, where each object represents an individual shot with properties including scene_id, shot_id, shot_number, shot_title, shot_description, roll_type ("A" or "B"), narration_text, word_count, expected_duration, suggested_broll_visuals, suggested_sound_effects, emotional_tone, and shot_notes.

Note that word_count and expected_duration will be calculated by the subsequent Shot Metrics Calculator node.
  
  ## Cinematographer & Editorial Planner Persona
     - Visual opportunities for emphasis
  4. For each identified shot:
-    - Determine an appropriate expected_duration based on content complexity and pacing
     - Classify as either A-roll or B-roll based on narrative function
     - Create descriptive shot_description that clearly explains what the shot contains
+    - Extract the specific narration_text for this shot from the scene narration
     - Define emotional_tone that aligns with the scene's intended impact
     - For B-roll shots, provide suggested_broll_visuals that enhance the narrative
     - Suggest appropriate sound_effects that complement the visual content
     - Create a shot_number and shot_title that clearly identifies its place in the sequence
+    - Note: You don't need to calculate word_count or expected_duration as these will be added by the Shot Metrics Calculator node
  5. Ensure the overall shot sequence maintains:
     - Narrative coherence across the entire scene
```

---

Now let's update the output example to match these changes:

---

```diff
      "roll_type": "A",
      "narration_text": "AI has revolutionized healthcare by enabling faster diagnosis and treatment planning.",
-     "word_count": 11,
-     "expected_duration": 4,
      "suggested_broll_visuals": "",
      "suggested_sound_effects": ["subtle interface interaction", "quiet hospital ambience"],
      "roll_type": "B",
      "narration_text": "Hospitals around the world now use advanced algorithms",
-     "word_count": 8,
-     "expected_duration": 3,
      "suggested_broll_visuals": "Animated world map with glowing points representing hospitals, subtle connection lines forming a network",
      "suggested_sound_effects": ["digital data processing", "soft global whoosh"],
      "roll_type": "B",
      "narration_text": "to analyze medical images and patient data,",
-     "word_count": 7,
-     "expected_duration": 3,
      "suggested_broll_visuals": "Medical scan with semi-transparent AI analysis overlay, showing detection boxes and data processing visualization",
      "suggested_sound_effects": ["medical imaging equipment", "data processing beeps"],
      "roll_type": "B",
      "narration_text": "leading to earlier detection of diseases",
-     "word_count": 6,
-     "expected_duration": 3,
      "suggested_broll_visuals": "Side-by-side comparison with timestamps showing AI detecting patterns significantly earlier than traditional methods",
      "suggested_sound_effects": ["positive detection tone", "time-lapse indicator"],
      "roll_type": "B",
      "narration_text": "and more personalized care.",
-     "word_count": 4,
-     "expected_duration": 2,
      "suggested_broll_visuals": "Tablet or display showing patient-specific treatment plan with multiple options and personalized elements highlighted",
      "suggested_sound_effects": ["gentle interface sounds", "soft conversation ambience"],
```

---

Now let's update the Error Handling and Output Document Generation sections to reflect this change in responsibility:

---

```diff
  
  - If Scene Blueprint has missing or invalid data for a scene, create generic shot divisions with LOW_CONFIDENCE flag
- - If expected_duration is missing, calculate based on narration length and scene complexity
  - If scene_description is ambiguous, create shots that focus on clear elements
  - Log all shot planning challenges for review
    "roll_type": "string (either 'A' for narration-driven or 'B' for supplementary visuals)",
    "narration_text": "string (specific narration text that accompanies this shot)",
-   "word_count": "number (word count of the narration text)",
-   "expected_duration": "number (estimated duration in seconds)",
    "suggested_broll_visuals": "string (visual suggestions for B-Roll shots)",
    "suggested_sound_effects": ["string (sound effect suggestion)", "string (another sound effect)"],
  }
  ```
+ 
+ Note: The Shot Metrics Calculator node will later add word_count and expected_duration fields based on the narration_text provided.
  
  The `shot_notes` field should follow this structured markdown format:
```

---

Finally, let's update the Example Processing Flow section to reflect these changes:

---

```diff
       - Determine if it should be A-roll or B-roll based on content and pacing needs
       - Extract the specific narration text for this shot
-      - Count words to help determine appropriate duration
       - Create a descriptive title and shot description
-      - Calculate expected duration based on content type and word count
       - For B-roll shots, suggest appropriate visuals
       - Identify emotional tone and suggest complementary sound effects
       - Generate structured shot notes with goals, engagement strategy, etc.
+      - Note: The word count and duration calculation will be handled by the Shot Metrics Calculator node
  
  4. **Balance A-roll and B-roll content**
  - Use pattern recognition to identify common shot structures
  - Implement consistent shot ID naming conventions for easier referencing
- - Calculate expected_duration based on narration speed and content complexity
  - Consider the downstream needs of the B-Roll Ideation node when structuring output
  - Analyze word count in narration segments to ensure B-roll shots follow the 5-13 word guideline
```

---

The Shot Segmentation agent has been successfully updated to align with the workflow document. Key changes include:

1. Updated the Output Format section to clarify that word_count and expected_duration will be calculated by the subsequent Shot Metrics Calculator node.

2. Removed the task of determining expected_duration from the Processing Guidelines, and added a note to clarify that word_count and expected_duration will be handled by the Shot Metrics Calculator node.

3. Removed word_count and expected_duration fields from the Example Output to match the expected output format.

4. Updated the Error Handling section by removing the error case related to missing expected_duration.

5. Modified the Output Document Generation section to remove word_count and expected_duration fields from the JSON structure, and added a note explaining that these will be added by the Shot Metrics Calculator node.

6. Updated the Example Processing Flow to remove steps related to counting words and calculating duration, and added a note clarifying that these tasks will be handled by the Shot Metrics Calculator node.

7. Removed the reference to calculating expected_duration from the Performance Optimization section.

These changes ensure that the Shot Segmentation agent focuses on its core responsibilities of breaking down scenes into shots, classifying them as A-roll or B-roll, and establishing optimal pacing, while letting the Shot Metrics Calculator node handle the more computational aspects of word counting and duration calculation.

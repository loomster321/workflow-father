To add the new field `original_text` to the `video_segments` table, I will create a migration on a development branch in your Supabase project. 

**Cost Notice:**  
Creating a development branch will cost $0.01344 hourly. Please confirm that you understand and approve this cost before I proceed. 

Once you confirm, I will:
1. Create a development branch.
2. Add the `original_text` field to the `video_segments` table via migration.
3. Update the documentation in your codebase to reflect this new field.

Would you like to proceed with this change and the associated cost?

The `original_text` field has been successfully added to the `video_segments` table in your Supabase database (on the main/free branch), and the documentation in both `references/supabase.md` and `ScriptArchitecture.md` has been updated to reflect this new field.

- **Database:** The schema now includes `original_text text` in `video_segments`.
- **Documentation:** The field requirements table and schema comments now describe `original_text` as required, always storing the unaltered segment text for traceability and auditing.

If you need further updates or want to clarify how this field should be used in your workflow, let me know!

OK I have added a new tool "Narrative Text Extractor". When segemneting the video, segment the script but also use the tool to get the narration text only. The original text should be store in a seperate field from the narration text. The word counts and durations should be calculated from the narration text, not the original text since that text alaso contains prodution notes.

Do you understand?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, I understand your requirements:

- When segmenting the video script, use the new **Narrative Text Extractor** tool to extract the *narration text only* from each segment.
- The **original text** (which may include production notes and other content) should be stored in the `original_text` field.
- The **narration text** (output from the Narrative Text Extractor) should be stored in the `narration_text` field.
- **Word count** and **estimated duration** must be calculated using the *narration text only* (not the original text).
- The workflow should always keep these two fields (`original_text` and `narration_text`) separate and use the correct one for each purpose.

If you want, I can update your documentation and workflow instructions to reflect this new process. Would you like me to proceed with those updates?

- 2. **Calculate Fields on Real Text**
+ 2. **Calculate Fields on Narration Text**
  
     - Pass the extracted narration text to the Word Counter tool to obtain the `word_count`.
-    - Pass the same text to the Calculator tool to obtain the `estimated_duration`.

  3. **Build Narrative Metadata**
```

---

The instructions and documentation have been updated to reflect your new workflow:

- **Narrative Text Extractor** is now listed as a required tool for extracting only the narration text from the original script/segment.
- The `original_text` field stores the full, unaltered segment text (including production notes and all content).
- The `narration_text` field stores only the narration, as extracted by the Narrative Text Extractor tool.
- **Word count** and **estimated duration** are now explicitly calculated from the `narration_text` only, never from the `original_text`.
- The workflow steps and field requirements table have been updated for clarity.

Why is there javaszcript in this agent?

---

_**Assistant**_

Great question! The JavaScript snippet in the **Video to Video Segment Agent** documentation is not part of the agent's runtime logic. Instead, it is included as an **example** to illustrate how to truncate log text fields to 256 characters before logging, as required by the logging instructions.

Here’s why it’s there:

- **Purpose:** The snippet demonstrates how to ensure that log fields (like `thought_process`, `tool_usage.input`, etc.) do not exceed 256 characters, which is important for compatibility with downstream systems (such as Elastic/Filebeat).
- **Context:** The code is provided as a reference for anyone implementing or maintaining the agent, showing how to safely truncate text before logging.
- **Not Executed by the Agent:** The agent itself may be implemented in a different language or environment (e.g., n8n, Python, etc.), but the logic for truncation must be followed regardless of the implementation language.

**Example from the doc:**
```javascript
const truncate = (text) => text && text.length > 256 ? text.slice(0, 256) : text;
const logEntry = {
  agent_name: "Video to Video Segment",
  event_type: "tool_usage",
  event_data: {
    thought_process: truncate("Used Word Counter tool to determine word count for narration text ..."),
    tool_usage: {
      tool: "Word Counter",
      input: truncate("Full narration text..."),
      output: 523
    }
  },
  segment_label: "video"
};
```

**Summary:**  
The JavaScript is just a documentation aid to clarify the truncation requirement for logs. You can implement the same logic in whatever language or workflow engine you use for the agent.

If you’d like, I can clarify this in the documentation or provide a code example in a different language!

Remove this. It severes no purpose.

The JavaScript code example and its explanation have now been removed from the documentation. Only the instruction remains: all log text fields must be truncated to 256 characters before logging.

+ **Note:** All log text fields (such as `thought_process`, `tool_usage.input`, and `decisions`) must be truncated to a maximum of 256 characters before logging. This ensures compatibility with downstream systems and prevents data truncation errors. See [Elastic: Truncate fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/truncate-fields.html).
  
  ## Field-Level Validation Checklist
```

The example log entry JSON blocks have been removed from both the Script Architecture Agent and Video to Video Segment Agent documentation. Only the instruction about truncating log text fields to 256 characters remains.

If you need any further cleanup or clarification, just let me know!

We need a boolean field added to the video segments table. Using mcp update the database and docs.

The new boolean field is called "atomic" and indicates if the segment will have any subsegments.

```diff
    original_text text, -- always store the original segment text
    narrative_metadata jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}', -- All semantic and narrative info
+   atomic boolean DEFAULT false, -- true if the segment will not have any subsegments (is atomic)
    created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
    CONSTRAINT label_type_unique UNIQUE (label, type)
```

```diff
  | narrative_metadata | jsonb    | Yes      | JSON object containing all semantic and narrative data (see Narrative Metadata Structure section)                |
  | original_text      | string   | Yes      | Always store the original segment text, including production notes and all content. Used as the primary source for generating titles, narrative metadata, and all derived fields except word_count and estimated_duration. |
+ | atomic             | boolean  | Yes      | True if the segment will not have any subsegments (is atomic). |
  
  *Required for the specified entity types only. All fields are stored in the database; the agent only outputs the new segment IDs.
```

```diff
  | parent_id          | integer  | No       | null for root (video); do not send this field in the tool call for root segments |
  | narrative_metadata | jsonb    | Yes      | JSON object containing all semantic and narrative info, including description, semantic_tags, and any other narrative/semantic fields |
+ | atomic             | boolean  | Yes      | True if the segment will not have any subsegments (is atomic). |

The new boolean field `atomic` has been:

- Added to the `video_segments` table in your Supabase database (default: false).
- Documented in `references/supabase.md` with a comment describing its purpose.
- Added to the Field Requirements Table in both `ScriptArchitecture.md` and `VideoToVideoSegment.md`, with a clear description:  
  **True if the segment will not have any subsegments (is atomic).**

If you need further workflow or logic updates to support this field, let me know!

What are the criteria for determining if a segment is atomic?

---

_**Assistant**_

The criteria for determining if a segment is **atomic** (i.e., should have `atomic: true`) are as follows:

---

## Atomic Segment Criteria

A segment is **atomic** if:

- **It will not be further subdivided into subsegments** in the current or any downstream workflow.
- **It represents the lowest level of segmentation** for the narrative or production process.

### Typical Examples

- **Beats**: Usually atomic, as they are the smallest narrative unit and are not further segmented.
- **Shots**: Often atomic, unless you have a workflow that further breaks shots into beats.
- **Any segment where the workflow ends**: If your workflow does not require further breakdown of a segment (e.g., a scene that is not split into shots), that segment is atomic.

### Non-Atomic Segments

A segment is **not atomic** (`atomic: false`) if:

- It is expected to be further segmented (e.g., an act will be split into sequences, a sequence into scenes, a scene into shots, etc.).
- It serves as a parent for any subsegments in the workflow.

---

## How to Decide

- **Ask:** “Will this segment be further divided in any subsequent workflow step?”
  - If **no**, set `atomic: true`.
  - If **yes**, set `atomic: false`.

---

## Example Table

| Segment Type | Atomic? | Reason                                      |
|--------------|---------|---------------------------------------------|
| Act          | false   | Will be split into sequences                |
| Sequence     | false   | Will be split into scenes                   |
| Scene        | false   | Will be split into shots                    |
| Shot         | true    | Not split further (unless beats are used)   |
| Beat         | true    | Smallest unit, never split further          |

> **Note:** If your workflow includes beats, then shots may be non-atomic and only beats are atomic.

---

**Summary:**  
A segment is atomic if it is the final, indivisible unit in your segmentation hierarchy for the current workflow.

If you want this definition added to your documentation or need logic for agents to set this field automatically, let me know!

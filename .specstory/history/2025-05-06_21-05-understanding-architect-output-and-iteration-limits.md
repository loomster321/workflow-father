# Understanding Architect Output and Iteration Limits (2025-05-06 14:05:58)

_**User**_

What would cause the architect to output this result?

---

_**Assistant**_

In the Script Architecture node you’re seeing that single line:

```json
[ { "output": "Agent stopped due to max iterations." } ]
```

That message comes straight from the agent’s built-in “self-critique → revise” loop.  By design, the Script Architecture Agent:

1. Generates an initial hierarchical structure  
2. Calls the Critic Agent to validate it  
3. If the Critic says “revise,” it fixes and repeats  
4. …and so on up to a hard stop (default is 5 iterations)

If, before passing, it exhausts that iteration budget, it aborts with exactly that “Agent stopped due to max iterations.” message.  

So in practice you’ll hit this whenever your input (or your node’s loop-limit setting) causes the agent to never reach a “pass” state within the allotted rounds of critique/revision.

Are the "## Implementation Notes" used for anything?

---

_**Assistant**_

The “## Implementation Notes” section in `ScriptArchitecture.md` is purely author‐facing documentation—guidance on how you (or another developer) would wire up things like the Word Counter and Calculator tools when authoring the n8n node. It isn’t parsed or executed by the Script Architecture Agent at runtime; it’s there to help you implement the node, not something the agent itself “uses” when running.

- ## Implementation Notes
- 
- - At each level, use the Word Counter Tool to calculate `word_count` for the segment text via the `query` parameter, and aggregate counts for parent levels.
-   - When calling the Word Counter Tool in n8n, use the proper node reference syntax:
-   ```javascript
-   // CORRECT way to call Word Counter Tool in n8n:
-   const wordCountResult = $node["Word Counter"].json;
-   segment.word_count = wordCountResult.word_count;
-   
-   // Example in context of actual usage:
-   const shotNarrationText = segment.narration_text;
-   // Pass to Word Counter Tool via input connection, then retrieve result
-   const wordCountResult = $node["Word Counter"].json;
-   segment.word_count = wordCountResult.word_count;
-   
-   // Example logging the word count calculation with proper event_type:
-   $node["Append Agent Log"].run(
-     "Script Architecture", // agent_name
-     "tool_usage", // event_type
-     {
-       "segment_label": segment.label,
-       "thought_process": "Calculating word count for narration text in current segment.",
-       "tool_usage": [
-         {
-           "tool_name": "Word Counter Tool",
-           "parameters": { "query": segment.narration_text },
-           "result_summary": `Counted ${wordCountResult.word_count} words in segment text`
-         }
-       ],
-       "decisions": [`Set word_count to ${wordCountResult.word_count}`],
-       "timestamp": new Date().toISOString()
-     },
-     segment.label
-   );
-   ```
- 
- - Use the Calculator Tool to estimate `estimated_duration` for segments with narration_text using the formula `word_count / 2.5`:
-   ```javascript
-   // Calculate duration for a segment with narration_text
-   const calculationResult = $node["Calculator"].run({ 
-     calculation: `${segment.word_count} / 2.5` 
-   });
-   segment.estimated_duration = calculationResult.result;
-   ```
- 
- - For parent segments (acts, sequences), the `estimated_duration` should be the sum of all child segment durations:
-   ```javascript
-   // Calculate parent duration by summing children
-   let totalDuration = 0;
-   for (const childSegment of segment.segments) {
-     totalDuration += childSegment.estimated_duration;
-   }
-   // Use Calculator Tool for the sum to ensure accuracy
-   const calculationResult = $node["Calculator"].run({ 
-     calculation: totalDuration.toString() 
-   });
-   segment.estimated_duration = calculationResult.result;
-   ```
- 
- - Maintain the recursive structure for all levels, using the `segments` array for nesting.
- - Ensure all required fields are present according to the rules above.
  
  ## Segmentation Logic and Hierarchy

I’ve removed the entire “Implementation Notes” section so the document now flows directly from Agent Boundaries into Segmentation Logic. Let me know if you’d like any further edits!

I don't think the agent stopped due to iterations. If you check supabase using MCP in the agent logging table there is only one entry and the critic was never called.

Something else is wrong. What are your theories?

---

_**Assistant**_

Here are a few different angles I’d explore—any one (or a combination) could explain why you only see the “Agent stopped due to max iterations.” message without ever calling the Critic:

1. Tool-list misconfiguration  
  – In the Node’s Settings you need to explicitly enable the Critic tool (e.g. `$node["Script Structure Critic"]`) alongside the Word Counter and Calculator. If it isn’t in your “Tools” list, the agent can’t invoke it, so the loop ends immediately.

2. Max-iteration default accidentally set to 1 (or 0)  
  – If your node’s “Max iterations” parameter got overridden (for instance to 0 or 1), the orchestrator will fire off the first pass (logging only the start), see that the loop‐counter has reached its limit, and bail out with that generic “stopped” message—never even entering a second iteration or calling the critic.

3. Empty or undefined prompt input  
  – A bad binding (e.g. using `{{$json.narrationScript}}` when your payload key is different) could mean the agent is working on a blank prompt. It may log “start_processing” but then immediately conclude there’s nothing to do and hit the iteration cap.

4. Prompt-length or token-limit error  
  – If your combined system+user messages exceed the model’s token budget, the Chat API can throw an error before returning any content. The orchestrator often surfaces that as “max iterations” rather than a more descriptive “token limit exceeded” in the UI.

5. Silent exception in your logging call  
  – If your first `$node["Append Agent Log"]` call mis‐names the node or has a bad Supabase config, it may write only the very first log and then crash out of the loop (again with the same fallback message).

6. Bug in the iteration/critique logic  
  – If the code that actually calls the Critic is behind a guard—say you only call it when the initial structure passes a sanity check—and that check is never satisfied, it will never invoke the critic and will simply terminate.

Next steps to narrow it down:

• Double-check the Node → Tools list to confirm the Critic is enabled and named exactly as you invoke it.  
• Inspect your node’s “Max iterations” setting (and any environment vars that might override it).  
• Add a quick debug log (or temporary `console.log`) right before you call the critic to see whether that branch is ever reached.  
• Look in n8n’s executions panel (and the full workflow logs) for hidden errors or API-error messages that might have been swallowed.  
• Try running with a minimal script (just a few words) to see if you hit a token-limit failure.  

Let me know what you uncover or if you want to walk through any one of these in more detail!

Schema & Field Validation**\n\n- All `act`, `sequence`, `scene`, `shot` levels are present and labeled correctly.\n- Required fields for each level are present:\n  - `act`, `sequence`, `scene`: `level`, `label`, `title`, `description`, `semantic_tags`, `word_count`, `estimated_duration`, `segments`\n  - `shot`: `level`, `label`, `description`, `semantic_tags`, `word_count`, `estimated_duration`, `narration_text`, `segments`\n  - `scene` and `shot`: have `narration_text`\n  - No `title` on shots.\n- No fields are empty or plainly marked as placeholders.\n- All segment labels are unique and follow a consistent naming scheme.\n- Recursive structure and required nesting within `segments` arrays appears correct.\n- No evident `LOW_CONFIDENCE` flags or missing information stubs.\n\nAppend Agent Log(\n  \"Script Structure Critic\",\n  \"validation_check\",\n  {\n    \"thought_process\": \"Validated schema compliance at all hierarchy levels.

Duration and Word Count Validation**\n\n- Use calculator to verify `estimated_duration = word_count / 2.5` for segments with `narration_text`.\n- Check parent segment durations match sum of child durations.\n\n*Calculator checks:*\n\n- For shots (scene 1, act 1, seq 1): \n  - shot-1: 30 words / 2.5 = 12, but listed duration is 5.0s (**DISCREPANCY**)\n  - shot-2: 42 words / 2.5 = 16.8, but listed duration is 7.0s (**DISCREPANCY**)\n- For scene: 72 words / 2.5 = 28.8, but scene is 12.0s (**DISCREPANCY**)\n- For act: child durations (12+5 = 17; +11=28; seems possible they didn't sum up exactly)\n- Several segments' durations do not match the formula.\n- Some shots exceed the recommended B-roll guideline for duration (should be 2–5s) and word count (10–15 words); e.g., shot-1 (30 words, 5.0s), shot-2 (42 words, 7.0s).\n- No beat-level subdivision for overly complex shots.\n\nAppend Agent Log(\n  \"Script Structure Critic\",\n  \"validation_check\",\n  {\n    \"thought_process\": \"Used calculator tool to compare word counts and durations.

Granularity & Segmentation (Score: 2)**\n- Multiple shots have narration text and word counts that far exceed the recommended B-roll shot limits.\n- Shots should rarely exceed 10-15 words and 2-5 seconds duration for production manageability.\n- No subdivision into beats for complex/long shots.\n- Montage shots are presented but not subdivided into proper beats for animation/visualization.\n\nAppend Agent Log(\n  \"Script Structure Critic\",\n  \"criterion_evaluation\",\n  {\n    \"thought_process\": \"Shots are overly long in narration and duration; complex montages are not sufficiently broken down for production.\",\n    \"decisions\": [\"Serious segmentation issues; shots need to be split into manageable beats.\"],\n    \"evaluation_details\": {\n      \"criterion\": \"Granularity & Segmentation\",\n      \"score\": 2,\n      \"issues_found\": [\n        \"Shot act-1_seq-1_scene-1_shot-1 has 30 words and 5s, expected max ~15 words/5s\",\n        \"Shot act-1_seq-1_scene-1_shot-2 has 42 words/7s, way above limits\",\n        \"Scene level also contains dense narration likely hiding multiple visual beats\"\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"\"\n)\n\n---\n\n**C. Semantic Annotation Quality (Score: 5)**\n- Semantic tags are clear, relevant, and diverse at each level.\n- Specialized tags appear appropriately (e.g., `montage`, `visual_cue`, `mentor`, `social_proof`).\n- Annotation will be useful for downstream production and creative teams.\n\nAppend Agent Log(\n  \"Script Structure Critic\",\n  \"criterion_evaluation\",\n  {\n    \"thought_process\": \"Semantic tagging is thorough and appropriate for all structure segments.\",\n    \"decisions\": [\"Assigned perfect score for semantic annotation quality.\"],\n    \"evaluation_details\": {\n      \"criterion\": \"Semantic Annotation Quality\",\n      \"score\": 5,\n      \"issues_found\": []\n    }\n  },\n  \"\"\n)\n\n---\n\n**D. Narrative Flow & Logical Structure (Score: 4)**\n- Logical flow from problem (act 1) to mentor/solution (act 2).\n- Within sequences/scenes, transitions are coherent.\n- Smooth progression, though visuals may be congested within individual shots/segments due to lack of subdivision.\n\nAppend Agent Log(\n  \"Script Structure Critic\",\n  \"criterion_evaluation\",\n  {\n    \"thought_process\": \"Narrative structure and progression are solid but a bit too compressed within segments.\",\n    \"decisions\": [\"Minor deduction due to segmentation granularity affecting flow clarity.\"],\n    \"evaluation_details\": {\n      \"criterion\": \"Narrative Flow & Logical Structure\",\n      \"score\": 4,\n      \"issues_found\": [\"Some shots are overloaded, which may blur narrative beats.\"]\n    }\n  },\n  \"\"\n)\n\n---\n\n**E.

Annotation & Field Completeness (Score: 5)**\n- All fields properly filled, none missing or empty.\n- Satisfies schema for required/optional fields at every depth.\n- No LOW_CONFIDENCE placeholders detected, which is acceptable since no ambiguous/missing elements detected.\n\nAppend Agent Log(\n  \"Script Structure Critic\",\n  \"criterion_evaluation\",\n  {\n    \"thought_process\": \"All fields are present and filled in; schema is fully honored.\",\n    \"decisions\": [\"Full marks for field completeness.\"],\n    \"evaluation_details\": {\n      \"criterion\": \"Annotation & Field Completeness\",\n      \"score\": 5,\n      \"issues_found\": []\n    }\n  },\n  \"\"\n)\n\n---\n\n**G.

# Markdown Formatting Guidelines 
- Use proper Markdown syntax for all system instructions
- Structure documents with clear hierarchical headings (# for main title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)
- Use bold (**text**) for emphasis on important concepts and requirements
- Use italic (*text*) for parameter names and minor emphasis
- Format code snippets and examples with proper code blocks (```javascript) including language specification
- Use bullet points for lists of related items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps or prioritized items
- Use blockquotes (> text) for important notes, cautions, and examples
- Create tables with proper markdown syntax for structured data and parameter definitions
- Use horizontal rules (---) to separate major sections when appropriate
- Include proper linking syntax for references to documentation
- Maintain consistent formatting patterns throughout the document
- Use inline code formatting (`text`) for short code references, parameters, and values
- Avoid excessive formatting that might interfere with LLM parsing
- Include a table of contents for longer instruction sets
- Use code comments within code blocks to explain logic
- Ensure proper indentation in both markdown and code examples
- Use HTML sparingly and only when markdown limitations require it
